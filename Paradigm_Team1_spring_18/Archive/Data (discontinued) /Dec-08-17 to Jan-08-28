Low listing fees are sometimes associated with agencies that don’t do much for clients. __ “The flat rate obviously is a great value,” he said. “Home sellers get 3-D virtual tours, a full-service offering, professional photography and a local real estate expert that actually shows up at the house and works with them throughout the process.” __ A typical listing fee is about 2.5 percent of the sale cost, and an additional 2.5 percent for the buyer’s agent. __ For a median priced home in San Diego County, $540,000 in November, a seller could save roughly $10,000 on listing commission fees. __ Eckardt said part of the reason Purplebricks, which formed in 2014, can keep costs low is because it does not have a lot of physical offices and they pass that savings on to consumers. __ Dana Kuhn, real estate lecturer at San Diego State University, said commission fees seem to be artificially high because it stays about the same in good times and bad. __ “When prices are high, it just makes more people into Realtors,” Kuhn said. “The (commission) model has survived for a long time, but is vulnerable now to online systems.” __ The real test of the company in the United States will likely be user reviews that are still being generated. Purplebricks launched in Los Angeles and Orange counties in September. __ Zillow’s review page of Purplebricks real estate agents in Irvine has 4.8 out of 5 stars with 38 combined sales in the last year. However, seven of the 18 sales for the agents were before Purplebricks launched and they were with different agencies. So, while reviews are out there, it will likely be a while before its clear if Purplebricks is catching on in the United States. __ In the United Kingdom, the company was in a well-publicized fight last year with the nation’s largest independent review site, allAgents. Purplebricks had questioned the authenticity of critical write-ups, reported Reuters, and allAgents responded by removing Purplebricks from its profile page, although it is now back up. __ The company’s success in the U.K. might negate the public spat. Revenues in the first half of 2017 were up 150 percent from the same time last year, but losses doubled as the company expanded into Australia and the United States, said the Financial Times. __ Nancy Fitzgerald, a Purplebricks agent in Irvine, said she does as much for clients now as when she was with other firms. Fitzgerald is one of the best reviewed Purplebricks agents in California on Zillow with clients praising her for quickly responding to inquires. __ “We do everything that a traditional agency would do. We probably do more,” she said. __ One thing assisting any low cost agency is homes are selling very quickly. The average days on market for a home in San Diego County in November was 29, down from 33 days the same time last year. __ Purplebricks also launched in Fresno and Sacramento on Monday. __ San Diego has agreed to sell 16 lots in Nestor for $1 each, in the pursuit of affordable housing. The nonprofit San Diego Community Land Trust plans to build three and four-bedroom homes there for people with moderate incomes. That means a family of five with an income of up to $102,750. __

But in a post-Harvey Weinstein world, some are questioning whether or not it’s appropriate to portray romance in the workplace. __ During ABC’s Television Critics Association press tour panel Monday in Pasadena, CA, the cast and producers of the new ABC legal drama “For the People” defended the choice to depict romance between coworkers on screen. __ It’s “still ok to fall in love,” said actress Hope Davis, who plays public defender Jill Carlan on the show. “That’s not the same as a boss abusing their power.” __ Also Read: How California Wildfires Affected Production on the 'Grey's Anatomy' Firefighter Spinoff __ Regé-Jean Page, who plays Leonard Knox, chimed in, “if there’s confusion about romance and abuse, we should show more romance.” __ “I don’t think sexual abuse of power in the workplace is a tricky territory,” said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. “I think it’s very clear what’s okay and what’s not.”  __ “And I don’t think it’s a tricky territory on our shows,” she continued. “When it happens, we talk about it.” __ Also Read: More 'Scandal'? ABC President Weighs in on Shonda Rhimes __ Rhimes added that her shows are works of fiction: “I think work isn’t the place to shoot people in the face either,” she said. “I think a lot goes on in these shows not appropriate in the real world.”  __ Creator Paul William Davies added that while there is romance and sex on “For the People,” it wasn’t a priority for him. “It doesn’t come out of the gate right away,” he said.  __ “For the People” premieres Tuesday, March 13 at 10 p.m. __ We've made it through another year of Shondaland and we're waiting (impatiently) for the return of TGIT in 2018. Here, we look back on some of the biggest twists this year from ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder."" __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When we found out Amelia had a brain tumor __ While so many of the surgeons at Grey-Sloan Memorial have had to have surgeries of their own, Dr. Amelia Shepherd's is the daddy of them all. We found out in Season 14 this year that she has had a giant brain tumor for years, and it's probably been behind some of her more questionable decisions. __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When we found out Megan Hunt was alive -- and has a son __ At the end of Season 13, we found out that Dr. Owen Hunt's little sister and the love of Dr. Nathan Riggs' life Megan Hunt isn't dead after all, and she's being air lifted back to the United States in critical condition. In Season 14, we found out she adopted a son while she was a prisoner of war. __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When the hospital got hacked __ In the Season 14 midseason finale, Grey-Sloan Memorial gets hacked with ransomware, but the implications are way bigger than just paying the millions of dollars ransom in Bitcoin. Just when Bailey tries to reach Jackson to transfer the money, he and Maggie get in a helicopter accident -- and we're left with a cliffhanger till the season returns in 2018.  __ ""Scandal"" __ When we thought Huck died  __ Remember when Huck's girlfriend Meg shot him multiple times and left him for dead?  We do.  It was the worst week of our life, waiting to find out if he lived or died. Also, it was basically Abby's fault.  Great job, Red. __ ""Scandal"" __ When they teased an epic Mama Pope confrontation __ In Season 6, we're left with a looming confrontation with Liv's mom and Rowan and Rosen teaming up to take her down, especially after wondering who this mystery henchwoman is.  __ ""Scandal"" __ When that plane explodes __ Quinn convinces Yasmeen to return home to Bashran, but that plan backfires as soon as the plane straight up explodes on the tarmac after Yasmeen and Rashad board, effectively igniting an international crisis.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Wes died ... and we find out who killed him __ If you haven't watched, we won't spoil who killed Wes, but we can promise you it will take some wild guessing (or Annalise Keating-level lawyering) to figure it out. The end of Season 3 had us reeling with this twist, and the loss of one of our favorite characters.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Laurel gets pregnant __ We find out Laurel is pregnant, and we think it's Wes' because of a strategically places flashback of Laurel telling him their condom broke. But later on it's revealed that Laurel was also sleeping with Frank at the same time, leaving the baby's parentage in question.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Annalise fires everyone, including Bonnie __ In the Season 4 premiere, Annalise lets everyone free of their duties working for her--including her sidekick Bonnie (which might end up as not such a great idea). We know by now that Annalise can be unpredictable, but the fact that she's letting the whole crew go given all the deep dark secrets they know seems out of character for how controlling of them she usually is. __ Which TGIT moment surprised you the most this year? __ We've made it through another year of Shondaland and we're waiting (impatiently) for the return of TGIT in 2018. Here, we look back on some of the biggest twists this year from ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder."""

The more creative types will also throw around the South Sea or Mississippi Bubble. You get the point. The consensus among the very smart experts is unanimous: bitcoin is clearly and indisputably a gigantic bubble that’s set to burst. I’ve been hearing this since the early days of getting involved in the space back in 2012. But I’m not convinced. __ For one thing, bubbles don’t do what bitcoin has done since its inception in 2009. During my 10-year tenure on Wall Street, I saw several bubbles grow and then burst, and one thing you learn is that an actual bubble rises like crazy and then totally pops. It doesn’t come right back a couple of years later and soar again to a new price 10 times greater than the previous bubble's high, which is what bitcoin has done after each one of its three or four previous “bubbles” burst. __ That’s not a bubble, but something else entirely. __   __  __ Let’s take the oil price in the middle of the last decade as an example of a real bubble. The price went on a historic and seemingly unstoppable run all the way to $150 per barrel in 2008. It then proceeded to burst in spectacular fashion just ahead of the financial crisis, plunging all the way back to $30 before rebounding. Ten years later and the price is still nowhere near that prior high, with it currently trading around $60. That’s what happens when a real bonafide bubble bursts. It stays below the prior high for decade at least, sometimes forever. The behavior of bitcoin since the ""genesis block"" has been completely different. __ While we’re on the topic of bubbles, it seems the truly gigantic bubble in the world isn’t bitcoin, but rather the global debt market. This leviathan now stands at around $233 trillion, or 318 percent of global GDP. Even more troubling, an estimated $11 trillion of government debt now trades at negative yields. This means whoever is buying this paper is doing so despite the fact they are guaranteed to lose money on the “investment.” Much of this buying has been propelled by central banks which can print their own currency and buy debt indiscriminately. This is not characteristic of a healthy financial system (particularly so many years into a global recovery), but rather a zombie one that’s been artificially propped up since the financial crisis. __ Therein lies the crux of the issue. __ Bitcoin and the crypto asset ecosystem it spawned seem to be a logical reaction to our zombified financial system, which itself is built upon the shaky foundations of a gigantic debt bubble. The rise of bitcoin foreshadows the emergence of something potent and new in the realm of money and finance, which also happens to be something the world desperately needs. __ Central Banks might be able to keep interest rates artificially low if they continue to aggressively buy government debt, but they can’t stop innovation or prevent millions of people across the world from moving into a different paradigm. The longer the zombie financial system is kept afloat, the more people will want to opt out of it and into a voluntary, decentralized alternative that’s far more ethical, transparent and permissionless. This desire for something distinct has been the driving force behind Bitcoin adoption since the very beginning. __ That’s not to say there isn’t bubble behavior going on in the broader crypto asset space at the moment, there certainly seems to be. __ Rather, it’s to say that reflexively calling Bitcoin a bubble because you don’t like it, or don’t understand it, is missing the much bigger picture. __ The real bubble is larger and far more dangerous, and it lies at the heart of the global financial system. If anything, bitcoin and other crypto assets are merely providing an escape hatch from this legacy system, while simultaneously offering an opportunity for a better and more decentralized future. __  Barter is timeless. __ It's both, not one or the other. __ In reply to  Barter is timeless. by VWAndy __  Trade in its most basic form.

Brown/Getty Images __ Paul William Davis explained his decision to recast one of the lead characters of his upcoming ABC legal drama “For the People” on Monday, sharing why “Girlboss” star Britt Robertson ended up with the part. __ And it’s not about race, he said. __ It was “not a conscious decision,” said Davis, to change the race of the character, even though Robertson is white and former lead Britne Oldford is not. __ “It really wasn’t [a factor], because it wasn’t like we moved from Britne to Britt,” Davies said. “We moved through a tracking period, looking at other actresses. And part of it was just redefining the role of Sandra. She plays a little bit differently than she did in the original version.” __ When the show was first ordered to series last May, it was promoted with “Skins” alum Oldford starring as Sandra Bell, a young New York public defender. ABC later announced that the character had been re-conceived with Robertson stepping into the role. __ Also Read: More 'Scandal'? ABC President Weighs in on Shonda Rhimes __ The character’s roommate, originally played by Lyndon Smith, was also recast, with Jasmin Savoy Brown now to play the part. __ “There was discussion with the network about the creative direction of the show,” Davies told reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour on Monday. “And so in the context of that, I ended up rewriting things. We also decided, just in the nature of the chemistry, that we would recast.” __ “I think those actresses, both of them are amazing, Britne and Lyndon,” he continued. “And I think Britt and Jasmin are incredible. There really is kind of a different dynamic.” __ Also Read: 9 Shocking Shondaland Twists of 2017 (Photos) __ The role went to Robertson shortly after Netflix dropped the axe on her Sophia Amoruso-inspired comedy “Girlboss” last summer, but Davies insisted that she wasn’t given the part because of her higher profile with American audiences. “ __ “There’s a little bit more of a spark plug element to the new Sandra,” he explained, saying the necessary changes became more apparent as he thought about the character going forward. “I think her weakness is more about her being a bit impulsive. She’s like a firecracker, she’s got this energy to her, which is intoxicating but also gets her into trouble. I think the first incarnation of Sandra, I didn’t think of her quite the same way.” __ Also Read: ABC Sets Midseason Premiere Dates, Schedules 'Scandal' Finale for April __ As a result of the changes, the ABC drama, which is executive produced by Shonda Rhimes and hails from her company Shondaland, briefly shut down production back in September. __ “Because a lot of the summer I spent rewriting, and then we did recast it, and we spent a lot of time recasting. Almost two months,” he said. “We were just backed up figuring out the episodes going forward. We had the pilot, we reshot it … We basically didn’t have the prep time over the summer that we would’ve had.” __ We've made it through another year of Shondaland and we're waiting (impatiently) for the return of TGIT in 2018. Here, we look back on some of the biggest twists this year from ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder."" __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When we found out Amelia had a brain tumor __ While so many of the surgeons at Grey-Sloan Memorial have had to have surgeries of their own, Dr. Amelia Shepherd's is the daddy of them all. We found out in Season 14 this year that she has had a giant brain tumor for years, and it's probably been behind some of her more questionable decisions. __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When we found out Megan Hunt was alive -- and has a son __ At the end of Season 13, we found out that Dr. Owen Hunt's little sister and the love of Dr. Nathan Riggs' life Megan Hunt isn't dead after all, and she's being air lifted back to the United States in critical condition. In Season 14, we found out she adopted a son while she was a prisoner of war. __ ""Grey's Anatomy"" __ When the hospital got hacked __ In the Season 14 midseason finale, Grey-Sloan Memorial gets hacked with ransomware, but the implications are way bigger than just paying the millions of dollars ransom in Bitcoin. Just when Bailey tries to reach Jackson to transfer the money, he and Maggie get in a helicopter accident -- and we're left with a cliffhanger till the season returns in 2018.  __ ""Scandal"" __ When we thought Huck died  __ Remember when Huck's girlfriend Meg shot him multiple times and left him for dead?  We do.  It was the worst week of our life, waiting to find out if he lived or died. Also, it was basically Abby's fault.  Great job, Red. __ ""Scandal"" __ When they teased an epic Mama Pope confrontation __ In Season 6, we're left with a looming confrontation with Liv's mom and Rowan and Rosen teaming up to take her down, especially after wondering who this mystery henchwoman is.  __ ""Scandal"" __ When that plane explodes __ Quinn convinces Yasmeen to return home to Bashran, but that plan backfires as soon as the plane straight up explodes on the tarmac after Yasmeen and Rashad board, effectively igniting an international crisis.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Wes died ... and we find out who killed him __ If you haven't watched, we won't spoil who killed Wes, but we can promise you it will take some wild guessing (or Annalise Keating-level lawyering) to figure it out. The end of Season 3 had us reeling with this twist, and the loss of one of our favorite characters.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Laurel gets pregnant __ We find out Laurel is pregnant, and we think it's Wes' because of a strategically places flashback of Laurel telling him their condom broke. But later on it's revealed that Laurel was also sleeping with Frank at the same time, leaving the baby's parentage in question.  __ ""How to Get Away With Murder"" __ When Annalise fires everyone, including Bonnie __ In the Season 4 premiere, Annalise lets everyone free of their duties working for her--including her sidekick Bonnie (which might end up as not such a great idea). We know by now that Annalise can be unpredictable, but the fact that she's letting the whole crew go given all the deep dark secrets they know seems out of character for how controlling of them she usually is. __ Which TGIT moment surprised you the most this year? __ We've made it through another year of Shondaland and we're waiting (impatiently) for the return of TGIT in 2018. Here, we look back on some of the biggest twists this year from ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder."" __ TheWrap's latest news and analysis from Television Critics Association press tour."

I have very little confidence that they have any long-term value."" __  Despite its dramatic gain in value, Dogecoin is still well behind the biggest digital currency, bitcoin, which has a total value of more than US$270b ($376.3b)."

 __ Twitter has long been a part of how CNBC's Jim Cramer interacts with viewers, gets feedback and finds the hottest, most talked-about trends in the market. __ ""Right now, the speculators are pressing me on three major issues: marijuana, cryptocurrencies and the stock of Micron,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Monday. __ Now, Cramer might get testy on Twitter from time to time, but he respects legitimate speculation when he sees it. __ But the ""Mad Money"" host was concerned that people buying marijuana stocks, bitcoin and its derivatives or shares of Micron didn't know they were actually speculating on these equities. __ ""They seem to think they're making a normal investment and I think that's a mistake,"" Cramer said. __ Cramer began with the cryptocurrency market. While he believed in its staying power, he said that derivatives and other speculative vehicles only make it harder to pin a precise value on a given digital currency. __ ""[They] ultimately don't sync with the value of the thing they actually represent, or tangential equities like an Overstock ... or a Square or AMD or Nvidia,"" Cramer said. ""I'll change my mind and become more positive the moment I see that cryptocurrencies are being treated like de-facto currencies, a la gold."" __ Next, Cramer turned to marijuana. Cannabis stocks took a hit last week after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed plans to rescind an Obama-era policy stating that the federal government couldn't override states' rights when it came to legalization. __ Cramer noted that while the global marijuana market would recover despite the setback, the domestic market seems to be facing further turmoil. __ ""As far as I'm concerned, there's way too much speculation in this sector already,"" he said. __ Finally, Cramer addressed the backlash he received after cautioning investors about the stock of Micron. __ His Twitter followers pounced after he detailed some potential negatives for the chipmaker on Friday and said he preferred the stocks of Nvidia and Broadcom. __ ""The bull case? Micron's stock sells for less than five times earnings,"" Cramer said. ""To me, though, that's exhibit A for the bears, because when Micron has sold that cheaply in the past, it usually means that the company won't be able to meet its earnings estimates."" __ The ""Mad Money"" host pointed out that Micron's two main products, flash memory and DRAM chips, are both commodities and subject to boom-and-bust cycles. __ Cramer said that pricing for flash memory chips peaked several months ago and DRAM could be following closely behind: a potential death knell for Micron's next earnings report. __ ""I've seen this stock collapse three separate times in my life and the circumstances were almost identical to those we're seeing right now: more supply coming on after a big run in price for DRAMs,"" Cramer said. ""The difference? This time Micron does have a second product line, flash, but as I mentioned, flash has peaked, and once commodities peak, they tend to stay down for ages."" __ So while the winds of demand, supply, power and politics could still blow in favorable directions for any of these three investments, Cramer wanted to set the record straight for speculators. __ ""Clever speculation always makes sense to me,"" Cramer concluded. ""But a recognition that you're speculating — not investing — would make me [feel] a whole lot better ... about anyone making these choices. Everyone focuses on the rewards from these kinds of stories, but you'll never get anywhere unless you start taking the risks as seriously as the rewards. That's right: calculate the risk, how much you can lose, not just how much you can win."" __ Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia and Broadcom. __ Questions for Cramer?

(Photo courtesy Wikimedia Commons / cc3.0)
 __ Cloud users and data center managers began to understand the performance effects of the patches required by the Meltdown/Spectre chip vulnerabilities over the weekend. While it seems initial fears of a 30 percent hit were overblown, there are plenty of users wondering what to do next after realizing they’re not getting everything they expected out of their hardware. __ It does seem that the impact of the patches required to address vulnerabilities in just about every chip in a data center was not universal, as Intel and cloud vendors predicted last week in rolling out their patches following the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities. First discovered last summer, the two hardware vulnerabilities are the result of a design flaw in modern processors that could allow malicious hackers to read sensitive data or eavesdrop on other applications running on a shared server. __ The mass of vendors we’ll call Big IT scrambled to assure its customers that the patches, which add some degree of overhead to operating systems and virtualization software depending on the type of workload, would not cause widespread performance problems. For the most part, that seems to be the case, as John Graham-Cumming, who oversees a huge network of servers as CTO of Cloudflare, reported: __ We continue to test various patches for #meltdown and #spectre but impact on @Cloudflare infrastructure appears to be negligible.  __ Impact on SRE and engineering time is a different matter… lots of effort going into testing and validating. __ — John Graham-Cumming (@jgrahamc) January 5, 2018 __ Yet there are definitely people having meetings this week to discuss what to do about the fact that their infrastructure strategy is now somewhere between one and 20 percent less effective.  __ Real information about tech performance can be surprisingly hard to come by, in part because performance can vary quite a bit across complex tech infrastructure, even ones designed to power the same industries. __ Vendors only want to highlight the best parts of their products, of course, and tech organizations can be reluctant to advertise their own issues to customers or competitors, regardless of the source. And these days, the contractual relationships between suppliers like Intel and customers like the cloud vendors are draped in legalese and non-disclosure agreements that prevent companies involved from talking freely about the situation. __ But those who are sharing information have identified several common and prominent workload scenarios seem to be getting hit the most. Representatives for Amazon Web Services and Microsoft either didn’t respond to a request for comment or declined to comment beyond the statements they issued last week about the expected performance impact of their patches. __ Google issued this statement, which seems to suggest any performance problems are your fault: __ “The performance impact seen by a cloud customer depends on two things: the mitigations put in place by the cloud provider, and any additional mitigations the customer chooses to deploy. We designed our mitigations for Google Cloud to have minimal impact on performance, and tested them before rolling them out. Customer-deployed mitigations may have different implementation strategies or offer varying protection against potential attacks and thus vary in their performance impact.” __ Red Hat compiled a list of the types of applications that users running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 are seeing from the patches added last week. __ The worst impact? __ Measureable: 8-19% – Highly cached random memory, with buffered I/O, OLTP database workloads, and benchmarks with high kernel-to-user space transitions are impacted between 8-19%. Examples include OLTP Workloads (tpc), sysbench, pgbench, netperf ( __ One of those workloads, OLTP (or, online transaction processing), is a fairly basic type of database used to, well, process transactions online. Any application that needs to request data from the operating system kernel on a regular basis is going to be hit by the mitigations necessarily to deal with Meltdown and Spectre, since until quite recently operating systems assumed the chip was capable of handling that securely. __ Red Hat said Java virtual machines fell into a lesser category where users could expect a three-to-seven-percent impact on their workloads, but the impact on some Java users was more severe: __ The fix for the #Intel CPU vulnerabilities has a #brutal effect on compile times. __ Compiling the #syslog_ng package on #Fedora changed drastically: from 4 minutes to 21! __ As far as I can see compiling #Java is affected most.#Meltdown #Spectre __ — Peter Czanik (@PCzanik) January 5, 2018 __ The fixes for Spectre, applied directly to the Linux kernel and other operating systems, appear to also be hitting performance for applications (Kafka data streams, in the below example) that tap into hardware virtual machines, as an AWS engineer confirmed lower in that Twitter thread. __ The #Meltdown patch (presumably) being applied to the underlying AWS EC2 hypervisor on some of our production Kafka brokers [d2.xlarge]. Ranges from 5-20% relative CPU increase. Ooof. pic.twitter.com/fXM0OzfdKx __ — Ian Chan (@chanian) January 6, 2018 __ So now comes the hard part. Cloud vendors and operating system vendors have emphasized that the protections they rolled out last week and early this week are preliminary, and they expect to develop better methods to deal with these vulnerabilities over time. __ Meltdown, the Intel-specific vulnerability, will likely fade into the background as companies apply the patch, which protects users from subsequent attacks and adjust to the new level of performance. But the remedies for Spectre (other than the multiyear-process now underway to redesign just about every chip in the world) only make exploiting that vulnerability more difficult, as opposed to closing the hole. And they only address known ways of exploiting Spectre; you can bet all your bitcoin that somebody, somewhere, is racing to find a new exploit for Spectre. __  __ That means cloud vendors and operating system companies will probably have to roll out additional fixes for Spectre-related issues until the installed base of data center chips turns over to new chips that lack these flaws, which will take forever given that Intel has roughly 95 percent of the data center chip market. __ That also means the cost of operating tech infrastructure is going to be a bit higher for a lot of companies in 2018. They didn’t necessarily plan on that, and tech vendors are going to have to make decisions about whether or not they pass the cost of that additional infrastructure on to their customers. __ We’ve seen CPU usage go from ~20% to ~40% (and now critical machines with redundancy upscale under loads that before didnt made them blink). Costs this month in AWS will go up 10%, I predict (very least, haven’t checked EMR effect yet, if similar, 20-30%) #spectre #meltdown #fb __ — Ruben Berenguel, PhD (@berenguel) January 6, 2018 __ AWS, Microsoft, and Google either did not respond to a request for comment, or declined to comment, on their plans for customers facing increased costs or decreased performance due to factors they could not possibly have controlled. __ We pioneered the global shift to cloud, social, mobile, and data science technologies, and we’ve been disrupting enterprise software ever since.

                                     __  Many market observers expect the crypto markets will have sharp spikes up and down this year compared to 2017.  __  A few weeks ago the bitcoin traded at more than $20,000, and at the end of 2017 the price dropped to around $11,000. This was followed by a rebound again, with bitcoin hitting about $16,500 on Saturday.  __  Meltem Demirors, director of the Digital Currency Group — an investment company which invests in currencies and crypto blockchain businesses — believes renewed momentum is on its way as Wall Street bonus season hits.  __  ""When Wall Street bonuses hit bank accounts on January 15, I imagine we'll see a crypto buying spree of epic proportions,"" Demirors wrote on Twitter earlier this year.  __  The traditional start of the year is a time when Wall Street traders can exert influence with their bonus payments, as many traders gamble with their extra income.  __  Mid-January bonuses likely clocked in at approximately $138,000, as can be deduced from calculations of the New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli.  __  Two decades ago, The New York Times wrote about about car salesmen in New York who significantly benefited from bonuses on Wall Street.  __  ""They are young, aggressive people who are able to make decisions spontaneously,"" the newspaper  quoted a car salesman saying at the time. ""They come to see what's in inventory, and when they receive their bonus checks — bingo.""  __  In 2018, the crypto market could get a boost from Wall Street bonuses.  __  ""Young people have been watching from sidelines putting in a few thousand here, a few hundred there,"" Demirors told Business Insider Deutschland. ""Bonus season and tax rebates means cash a plenty to put into crypto.""

Watch how Jabil achieved security at scale with Zscaler. __ This is the seventh in a series of blogs collecting the recent activity of the current top exploit kits. Exploit kits are rapidly deployable software packages designed to leverage vulnerabilities in web browsers to deliver a malicious payload to a victim’s computer. Authors of exploit kits offer their services for sale, distributing malware for other malicious actors. __ Find our previous roundup here. __ RIG EK has maintained its position as the most active exploit kit, but overall volume of RIG traffic was down over the fall quarter. In November, RIG activity declined significantly, and this trend continues throughout December. RIG continues to install ransomware, banking trojans, and cryptocurrency mining software on vulnerable systems. __  __ Figure 1: RIG hits, September 2017 – December 2017 __  __ Figure 2: RIG Heat Map __ Though still consistently active, the volume of RIG activity dropped significantly in November 2017. Global distribution of RIG activity has also changed since our last roundup. For the last quarter, virtually all observed RIG traffic has been within the United States, Russia, and Japan. This was unexpected, as previous analyses had shown an appreciable amount of activity in Europe, the rest of the Americas, and Southeast Asia. __ Among the number of concurrent RIG campaigns this year, the “Seamless” campaign has garnered the most interest. In our Summer 2017 EK Roundup, we covered some of the details of the Seamless campaign, which began early in 2017. This campaign is primarily responsible for infecting victims with the Ramnit banking infostealer. __ While most of the changes to RIG EK this year have been relatively insignificant, such as the constant variation of URI variable names in transactions with the exploit kit landing page, a recent usage of the “Punycode” URL encoding method caught the interest of many researchers. Punycode is a method of encoding Unicode characters within normal ASCII URL strings, which received a significant amount of attention this year for being used in numerous phishing attacks. Attackers use Punycode to display URLs in the victim’s browser that are visually similar to trusted websites in what is called an “IDN homograph attack”. Punycode was previously used by the Blackhole exploit kit in 2013 as part of an email spam campaign. __  __ Figure 3: Observed RIG infection attempts using Punycode URLs __ This campaign uses the Punycode URL xn--80af6acah5f[.]xn--p1acf, which encodes to the unicode URL рогаоыо[.]рус displaying Cyrillic characters. Other variations of this URL have been observed, including one detailed by Jérôme Segura. __ Cryptocurrency mining payloads delivered by exploit kits are becoming increasingly common. These coin-mining packages typically mine alternative cryptocurrencies such as Monero, which have a greater emphasis on privacy and anonymity than Bitcoin. This aids the malicious actors profiting from the cryptocurrency mining in evading tracking by law enforcement agencies. __ Earlier this fall we observed a one-off RIG campaign that used a different malicious redirect structure than the common RIG campaigns to deliver the exploit kit. This campaign infected victims with the Dofoil Trojan, which then installed the malicious BitCoinMiner cryptocurrency mining tool. __  __ Figure 4: RIG redirect __  __ Figure 5: RIG cycle __ After the coin mining software is installed, it attempts to connect to 21072206[.]ru to begin mining. __ Terror EK is a more recent exploit kit discovered in late 2016. This kit was formed as an amalgamation of several active exploit kits, particularly using code and exploits taken directly from Sundown EK. Initially, Terror was relatively unsophisticated and was primarily used to infect victims with cryptocurrency mining packages, but has since undergone a number of upgrades. __ Terror has been relatively active over the last quarter. Since our last roundup, we have observed several changes in the EK infrastructure and fingerprinting mechanisms. __ The majority of detected Terror EK cycles were seen delivered via malvertising campaigns using the Propeller Ads network. Below are the few of domains that were seen redirecting users to the terror EK landing pages: __ tqeobp89axcn[.]com __ 8b0b17dc1f9f8010[.]com __ serve.popads[.]net/s?cid=XXX&iuid=XXX&ts=XXX&ps=XXX&pw=XXX&pl=! __ pianodisagree[.]webcam __ yakset[.]accountant __ b-consulting[.]nl __ The users were being redirected from few known pirate video streaming and online gaming sites seen below: __ btcheat[.]com __ mp3spongebob[.]tk __ putlockers[.]fm __ mp3old[.]tk __ watch-series[.]is __ widestream[.]io __ download.planetlagu[.]online __ flvto[.]biz __ musicpleer[.]es __ sockshare[.]net __ onlineatv[.]com __ Few of the changes that we saw as compared to start of the year is the use of encoding in the flash exploits used by the exploit kit. We had made detailed analysis of changes in the our previous blog on Terror EK __ The previous EK Cycle can be seen below, __  __ Figure 6: Terror EK cycle __ Terror EK has begun using HTTPS instead of HTTP on its landing pages. __  __ Figure 7: HTTPS connection to a Terror EK Landing Page __ Heavy fingerprinting techniques using ad redirects to evade detections by only redirecting the users to the landing page when they meet specific target conditions. If the targets do not meet requirement then they are commonly redirected to fake Flash Player downloads, free online gaming sites or shopping portals. __ The most recent Terror campaigns were seen using the ever-popular CVE-2016-0189 Internet Explorer exploit. __ Magnitude EK is one of the longest-running exploit kits, first launched in 2013. This exploit kit has seen much lower volume activity in recent years, compared to RIG, Angler, and Neutrino (when the latter two were active). Significant changes in Magnitude campaigns are infrequent. __ In our last roundup, we noted that Magnitude EK was primarily targeting Southeast Asian countries with malvertising campaigns. This trend continued through the fall quarter, with an increased presence of Magnitude activity specifically targeting South Korea. __ Disdain EK is a brand new exploit kit that first appeared in early August. It shares code with Terror EK and uses the same URL pattern, but has many other distinct features. Disdain is currently operating at very low activity, but has been observed distributing the Kasidet infostealer. Malwarebytes has detailed Disdain’s use in alongside a “Fake Flash Player” social engineering attack. __ Exploit kits pose a significant threat to users during simple web browsing. In the case of ransomware infections, the result could be the inability of a user to access his or her files. The techniques exploit kit authors use to hide their activities are frequently changing, and security researchers work hard to analyze and block these new threats. __ To help avoid infections such as these, users should always block untrusted third-party scripts and resources, and avoid clicking on suspicious advertisements. Zscaler’s ThreatLabZ has confirmed coverage for these top exploit kits and subsequent payloads, ensuring protection for organizations using Zscaler’s Internet security platform. __ Zscaler security is so comprehensive, you can forget about it.

Nearly a dozen Democrats have sponsored the legislation. __ The Crapo bill seems likely to pass the Senate without issue, but House conservatives have already expressed opposition to the compromise. __ The bill would exempt small and mid-size banks from the most stringent parts of Dodd-Frank and scale back federal oversight of the financial system as a whole. But it contains no efforts to rein in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which would have poisoned the effort for Democrats. __ The bill's lack of restraints on the CFPB has already cost it support in the House. Several GOP members of the House Financial Services Committee told The Hill that they couldn't support a bill that doesn't touch the bureau, long loathed by Republicans and the finance industry: http://bit.ly/2AGh0lj. __   __ Perdue calls on Canada to fully engage in NAFTA talks: Agriculture Secretary Sonny PerdueGeorge (Sonny) Ervin PerdueTrump proposes restricting choices for food stamp recipients Regulatory restructure of biotech is critical to the future of US agriculture The Hill's 12:30 Report MORE on Monday urged Canada to more fully engage in the push to complete an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). __ Perdue, who called the upgrade of NAFTA a top priority for the Trump administration, specifically asked Canada to step up and ""get in the game"" to modernize the 24-year-old three-nation agreement, during remarks to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Nashville, Tenn.  __ ""All sides have to roll up their sleeves and get to work,"" Perdue said. __ He asked convention attendees to talk to Canada's Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay ""to get our partner to the north to get the deal done for them and for you."" __ The remarks closely echo those of U.S. Trade Representative Robert LighthizerRobert (Bob) Emmet LighthizerMORE, who said in the fall that he was ""surprised and disappointed"" by the resistance of Mexico and Canada to updating NAFTA. __ Both nations have complained that many of the U.S. proposals put forth early in the talks were non-starters.

GOP lawmakers said they hoped that would motivate high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California to curb their own taxes and spending. __ But politicians in blue states view the tax law as an attack on them, and are pushing back.  __ ""We sort of have two choices. One choice is to step back and let this happen to us. Or the other is to get into the arena and fight like heck,"" New Jersey Gov.-elect Phil Murphy (D) said at a news conference Friday. ""And this is New Jersey after all."" __ The tax law is just one of the ways Republicans have taken aim at Democratic-leaning cities and states in recent months.

21,IAN McGUGAN,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/why-this-is-such-a-treacherous-time-for-investors/article37533379/,2018-01-08T22:55:14Z,Beware the market 'melt-up' - it may come back to bite you,"The subject who is truly loyal to the Chief Magistrate will neither advise nor submit to arbitrary measures. __ Stock markets have begun the year in an exuberant mood, and for good reason. __ Economic data are coming in strong around the globe and several years of superb returns, especially in the United States, have conditioned Main Street investors to expect more gains ahead. __ Even notable grouches such as Jeremy Grantham of GMO LLC in Boston acknowledge that today's market seems determined to spike higher. An optimist (and everybody appears to be one these days) could well assert that this is a prime time to bet on stocks. __ Story continues below advertisement __ Fair enough. But a warning is also in order: It would take very little to reverse today's ebullience. Investors should consider not just how much money they could make over the next few months if things go right, but how much they're prepared to lose if anything derails the market's upward climb. __ Mr. Grantham, who foresaw both the dot-com crash and the U.S. housing debacle, says there's more than a 50-per-cent chance of a melt-up, or frantic rise in stock values, within the next six months to two years. Such melt-ups often occur toward the end of market cycles. __ However, Mr. Grantham says such a melt-up would nearly certainly be followed by a subsequent melt-down that would wipe out half the market's value. __ To put it more succinctly, this is a treacherous time for investors. Stay conservative and you may miss out on big gains. Go all in and you risk having your portfolio eviscerated. __ For now, people are embracing risk. According to TD Ameritrade, retail investors ended 2017 with the highest exposure to stocks on record. Institutional investors are ""loading the boat on risk,"" Morgan Stanley says, and using levels of borrowed money that are ""as high as we have ever seen."" __ One reason for the prevailing bullishness is U.S. tax reform. The cuts approved by Congress in December are expected to boost corporate profits and fuel more stock-market gains. __ Wall Street strategists are nearly always an optimistic group, but several are now being forced to raise their S&P 500 price targets for 2018. They're doing so because the strong start to the year has already propelled stock prices close to where strategists figured they would be 11 months from now. __ Story continues below advertisement __ Story continues below advertisement __ Yet, just as forecasts are headed higher, many of the drivers of this nearly nine-year-old bull market are losing strength. __ One fading support is the notion that stocks are clearly better than any other investing option. Ever since the financial crisis, bulls have argued there is no alternative to stocks, especially for income investors, because bond yields are so miserably low. __ That's no longer necessarily true: The S&P 500 features a paltry dividend yield of only 1.8 per cent, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond delivers a payoff of nearly 2.5 per cent. __ In Canada, the situation is more attractive for equity investors, but only slightly. The S&P/TSX composite index pays a dividend yield of 2.7 per cent, compared with a 10-year Government of Canada bond yield of nearly 2.2 per cent. A cautious, income-oriented investor could reasonably choose either. __ In both countries, exuberance is surging, often in questionable directions. The rush to buy bitcoin seems similar to the dot-com bubble. So does the stampede for marijuana stocks. __ Previous market bubbles have ended with periods of spectacular acceleration, where prices on average shoot up by 60 per cent or more over the course of about 3.5 years, according to Mr. Grantham. Over the past six months, gains in U.S. stocks have picked up pace, perhaps setting the stage for such a crest. __ Story continues below advertisement __ ""A range of nine to 18 months from today and a price rise to around 3,400 to 3,700 on the S&P 500 [which now stands at around 2,750] would show the same 60 per cent gain over 21 months as the least of the other classic bubble events,"" he writes. __ The problem is that no two bubbles are alike. So what to do? Mr. Grantham recommends holding as much exposure to emerging-market stocks as you can stand, because valuations there look more attractive than closer to home. __ In addition, you should beware the melt-up. If markets go on a tear in coming months, take it as an opportunity to reduce your stock exposure. Leaving the good times will hurt, but it could spare you from the pain that will follow. __  Latest Videos  __ © Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail Inc.

 __ The cryptocurrency market may be just what is needed to lure millennials into trading, TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan told CNBC on Monday. __ Digital currencies fell on Monday but have made huge gains over the past year. __ ""People complain that we haven't gotten millennials to trade. Maybe this isn't the product I'd like people to start with, but this is the greatest opportunity we've had in the market to get people who weren't traditionally interested in the market,"" he said in an interview with ""Closing Bell."" __ Over the past year, bitcoin — the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap — is up more than 1,500 percent. Ripple, meanwhile, ripped 35,000 percent last year alone. __ The steep rise of bitcoin has led some, such as J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, to call bitcoin a ""fraud"" and others to declare it is in a bubble. __ Last month, TD Ameritrade announced it was offering clients access to Cboe's bitcoin futures, which began trading in December. __ The company is one of the top three retail brokerages, according to capital markets research and consulting firm Tabb. __ Kinahan said the firm traditionally likes to advise clients to use 10 percent of their money to speculate, but what millennials are saying is they want to use 90 percent to speculate. __ ""Do I agree with that? Not necessarily, but for us to say 'you're wrong' is silly,"" he said.

But could this unprecedented growth in value attract cybercriminals? __ Currently, there is a huge bullish run by Bitcoin and other alternate coins on the cryptocurrency market even with the recent correction that saw Bitcoin slightly drop in value over the holidays. However, now that the New Year has kicked off, cryptocurrencies are going up in price.  But could this surge in value be open season for cybercriminals? __ For instance, the month of December last year saw Coinbase (a leading exchange in the US) temporarily suspended Bitcoin Cash trading on its platform amid allegations of insider trading. In addition to that, the US Securities and Exchange Commission stopped a fraudulent initial coin offering for the first time. The fraudsters had lured thousands of investors with a promise of doubling their investments within months while the ICO raised $15 million. __ Insider trading and fraudulent ICOs aside, the real threat to digital currencies still remains cyber theft. Simply put, hackers and cyber criminals pose a much more frightful menace to investors. __ After all, we are living in a sophisticated digital age and since there are widespread digital tools and avenues that a hacker can use, the average person can hardly avoid or stop an attack once it begins. __ Frankly, one of the biggest pain points in the world of cryptocurrency is cybercrime.  In fact, a report from the US Department of Homeland Security reports that between 2009 to 2015, more than a quarter of Bitcoin exchanges were attacked. __ Surprisingly, however, such reports have not been enough to keep cryptocurrencies from growing in value. Cyber criminals follow the money, however, and at the moment, it’s easy to see that the cryptocurrency market is where the money is as it currently stands at a market capitalization of about 816 billion according to CoinMarketCap. __ With the rising price of Bitcoin, cyber heists have become even more profitable as it only takes a single attack to potentially make off with millions of dollars. __  __ With the cryptocurrency prices on the rise, investors need to be more vigilant than ever when it comes to protecting their digital assets. In most countries, the U.S. included, digital currencies are not recognized as legal tender so investors have little to no recourse when their funds are stolen. __ So, how can an individual investor take measures to protect a digital assets account? No measure is absolutely foolproof but there are steps that you can take to minimize your risk of theft: __ Do you believe that no one including well-funded corporations is 100 percent safe from hackers? What are you doing to protect your cryptocurrencies?

Rich Guy Says ‘Bitcoin is Bad’ Vasant Prabhu, the chief financial officer of Visa — the world’s biggest payment network by market value — has taken time out of his busy schedule to bury Bitcoin beneath a mountain of negativity. In addition __ The head of the Bank of England Mark Carney has told members of the G20 that cryptoassets “do not pose risks to global financial stability.” Carney: Crypto Is No Match For Credit Default In a statement released Sunday a day before the group begins a summit in Argentina, Carney appeared to broadly copy the approach to crypto regulation seen from US regulators in February.

Jason Saine of Lincoln County and Attorney General Josh Stein announced on Monday details of the draft legislation, which comes after a spike in cyber attacks last year.  __ Saine said the bill would require companies who are hacked to notify consumers more quickly. Uber recently acknowledged a massive data breach a year after it happened. __ ""That is certainly not a reasonable time frame to let someone know that their information has been breached,"" Saine said. ""We've looked at practices all across the United States and what different states are doing, and we'll certainly combine that into the bill."" __ Mecklenburg County was the victim of a ransomware attack last month. Hackers demanded $23,000 in bitcoin to release the county's data. Mecklenburg officials had backups of the information and did not pay. Meanwhile, Duke Energy recently announced a potential breach of more than 300,000 customers' billing information. __ Stein said scams and cyber attacks spiked in 2017. __ ""Last year in North Carolina, there were over 1,000 breaches - 1,022 - which is an increase of 15 percent from 2016. That affected 5.3 million North Carolinians,"" he said. The draft bill would also make it easier for consumers to get credit reports, and freeze their credit if their information has been compromised. __ Saine said he plans to introduce the bill during the General Assembly's short session, which convenes in the spring.  __ View the discussion thread. __

The malware itself appears pretty basic, and the inclusion of the KSU server in the code could simply be a false flag to trick security researchers. Even so, the malware is consistent with previous similar campaigns tied to North Korea, AlienVault said. __ ""Cryptocurrencies could provide a financial lifeline to a country hit hard by sanctions,"" the vendor said. ""Therefore it's not surprising that universities in North Korea have shown a clear interest in cryptocurrencies."" __ A cryptocurrency mining tool like xmrig is basically designed to harness the processing power of a computer in order to verify transactions in a blockchain. Users who put their computers to work mining virtual currencies such as Bitcoin and Monero typically receive small monetary rewards for allowing their hardware to be used for the purpose. __ Crypto mining is legitimate activity. Some, like Coinhive, even distribute miners to website operators so users can run it in their browsers in exchange for an ad-free experience. In recent years, though, cybercriminals have increasingly begun hijacking computers in order to mine cryptocurrency for illegal profit. __ In a report last September, IBM said that between January and July 2017 it had seen a six-fold increase in CPU mining attacks involving the use of malware for installing virtual currency mining tools against its customers. The tools typically were embedded in fake image files that were hosted on infiltrated servers running WordPress or Joomla. Most of the attacks that IBM analyzed were designed to target virtual currencies such as Monero, whose CryptoNight algorithm can run on ordinary PCs and servers compared to the specialized hardware required for Bitcoin mining. __ Last September, Kaspersky Lab reported finding two relatively large botnets comprised of computers infected with malware for installing legitimate cryptocurrency miners on them. The security vendor estimated that a 4,000-computer botnet used for cryptocurrency mining was netting its operators up to $30,000 a month, while a bigger 5,000-computer botnet was garnering its operators some $200,000 a month. __ ""As the price of crypto-currencies increase, so do the incentives to infect people with mining malware,"" says Chris Doman, security researcher at AlienVault. ""Monero is becoming a popular choice as it is both more anonymous and more profitable to mine with malware."" __ Security researchers have found plenty of clues in recent months to suggest that Korea-linked threat actors like the Lazarus Group and others are actively engaged in cryptocurrency mining. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported an incident in which a North Korea threat group called Andariel hijacked a server belonging to a South Korean organization and used it to mine about 70 Montero coins. __ The Lazarus group has been caught doing Monero mining on compromised networks and attacking Bitcoin exchanges, Doman says. There have also been several public reports of North Korean universities looking into mining cryptocurrencies, Doman says. So while it is hard to say with complete certainty if the malware that AlienVault discovered is the work of North Korean actors, chances are high it is, he notes. __ ""The main takeaway for me is that this fits into the larger picture of North Korea and cryptocurrencies."" __ Related Content:"

                                         Posted  January 8, 2018  __ Dear Reader, __ My readers know I’m not a bitcoin proponent. I don’t deny that it’s made some people a lot of money, but I believe bitcoin is a massive bubble right now. __ Yet it’s been reported in some circles that I’ve recently come out in favor of bitcoin. __ It’s not true. __ Now, it is true that I’ve stated my belief in blockchain technology, which is the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There’s great promise here. And despite what some critics may claim, I’m not some technophobe who doesn’t understand the technology underlying cryptos. __ I know it very well. I’ve been studying cryptos since before many of their current owners even heard of bitcoin. I actually worked with the intelligence community to counter ISIS’s use of cryptocurrencies to bypass the international money system. __ And in my opinion, the hype has run far ahead of reality. This is reflected in bitcoin’s meteoric and unsustainable rise. But again, I also believe blockchain technology is for real and has great potential. So just because I’m not a bitcoin cheerleader doesn’t mean I’m opposed to all blockchain-based cryptos. __ (In a few weeks, I’ll actually be conducting a debate with leading cryptocurrency expert James Altucher. The topic will be gold versus bitcoin, and I can’t wait to give viewers the whole story. Stay tuned for details.) __ Today, I want to talk a little more about how gold and blockchain technology could lead the world away from the dollar-based system… __ Despite everything you may hear in the mainstream media, gold is as relevant as ever. __ Russia and China, for example, have been accumulating thousands of tons of physical gold bullion for the last 10 years. That’s not news, of course. __ What is news is that both countries are starting to make moves toward the end game of a gold-backed currency that completely bypasses the U.S. dollar payments system. __ These moves are both geopolitical and monetary. __ In fact, they track the gold-based attack on the U.S. dollar that I devised for the Pentagon in their first-ever financial war game in 2009. That financial war game is described in detail in my 2011 book, Currency Wars. __ It looks like the Russians and Chinese read my book! __ According to Russian government officials attending a recent monetary conference in Moscow, Russia, China and their BRICS allies are moving toward their own gold trading system (bypassing London and New York). __ From there it’s a small step toward a new gold-backed digital currency using distributed ledger technology and military-grade encryption. Distributed ledger technology is another term for the blockchain technology I discussed above. __ But unlike cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, this digital system is backed by gold. __ Once that system is up and running, the BRICS can trade and settle oil, commodities, weapons, manufactured goods and the overall balance of payments without using dollars or Western financial intermediaries at all. __ And from there, a global loss of confidence in the dollar is not far behind. Do you think bitcoin will win the most in this scenario? __ It won’t. The big winner in all of this will be gold. __ Below, my colleague and senior geologist Byron King shows you how Russia is stockpiling gold as a “fire escape” currency to bypass the U.S.-backed monetary system. Read on to see how this development will dramatically affect the price of gold in the years to come. __ Regards, __ Jim Rickards

 __  North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein announced on Monday that he planned to investigate Uber as part of his office’s attempts to strengthen consumer protections against data breaches. __ The announcement came up during a news conference in which Stein, a Democrat, teamed up with Rep. Jason Saine, a Lincoln County Republican, to advocate for legislation that would require companies that experience data breaches to notify consumers more quickly. __ Saine said he plans to introduce the proposal during the General Assembly’s short session which begins in May. He hopes to gain support from both parties. __ “Obviously with the attorney general and I before you, it’s already a bipartisan effort,” Saine said at a news conference on Monday. __ Sign up today for a free 30 day free trial of unlimited digital access. __ Last year, according to Stein, more than 5.3 million North Carolinians were estimated to have been affected by a data breach. __ “This number is staggering and unacceptable,” Stein said. __ Mecklenburg County was the victim of a ransomware attack last month. Hackers demanded $23,000 in bitcoin to release the county’s data, but county officials had backups of the information and did not pay. Duke Energy also recently announced a potential breach of more than 300,000 customers’ billing information. __ Uber recently acknowledged a massive data breach, but it took the company more than a year to let its customers know. __ “That is certainly not a reasonable time frame to let someone know that their information has been breached,” Saine said. “We’ve looked at practices all across the United States and what different states are doing, and we’ll certainly combine that into the bill.” __ Stein said scams and cyber attacks spiked in 2017. __ The most commonly stolen information includes full names, dates of birth and Social Security, driver license, and credit card numbers. __ “Last year in North Carolina, there were over 1,000 breaches – 1,022 – which is an increase of 15 percent from 2016. That affected 5.3 million North Carolinians,” Stein said. __ In addition to forcing companies to reveal breaches on a more timely basis, the proposed legislation also would make it easier for consumers to get credit reports and freeze their credit if their information had been compromised. __ Anne Blythe: 919-836-4948, @AnneBlythe1 __

The mined coins are then sent on to a server based at Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang. __ The malware – which installs itself as intelservice.exe in what is likely an attempt to hide among legitimate products from Intel Corp – was identified by AlienVault through a database of computer viruses put together by the Google subsidiary VirusTotal. Cryptocurrency mining needs a lot of operating power resulting in mounting electricity bills, which is why hackers often try to reassign the task to a network of compromised PC’s under their control. __ “So running [the cryptocurrency-mining software] on someone else’s computer means you don’t have any costs, only profit,” Chris Doman, the AlienVault threat engineer who identified the virus, told the Wall Street Journal. __ Faced with severe international sanctions, some analysts have suggested that Pyongyang may be looking at unorthodox ways to raise capital. Last year, North Korea was accused of a series of online heists on banks and bitcoin exchanges in South Korea and Taiwan. But the rather primitive level of programming found in the code led AlienVault’s experts to suspect it was more of an amateur effort rather than something tied to the North Korean government. __ “Given the amateur usage of Visual Basic programming in the Installer we analyzed, it’s unlikely the author is part of Lazarus [a group of hackers linked to the government],” AlienVault’s report read. “As the mining server is located in a university, we may be looking at a university project.” __ However, the university’s server doesn’t seem to be connected to the wider internet, so the final destination of the coins could be another server and that this is just a ruse to trick security experts. Another possibility is that it could be designed solely for the university’s network itself, as part of a legitimate mining project, but this scenario doesn’t explain why the program would try to disguise itself. __ Access to the internet in North Korea is very limited – only a select group of officials can go on the World Wide Web, while a larger circle, including students and researchers, can use the country’s domestic intraweb. But Kim Il Sung University is also home to a number of foreign students and staff, so it’s possible the code’s authors are not even Korean. __ Monero is the 13th largest cryptocurrency in the world and is considered to have even better value for privacy than bitcoin. It is still unknown how and where exactly the crypto-mining malware was first spotted, and how many (if any) Monero coins it has mined. __ RT News App __ © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2018.

 __ Ethereum co-creator Steven Nerayoff says increased projects built on the cryptocurrency could trigger a ""flippening"" in 2018, in which ethereum overtakes bitcoin. __ ""What you're seeing with ethereum is exponential increase in the number of projects — there are billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem right now — maybe 10 times more projects this year than last year, which could easily lead to a doubling, probably a tripling in price by the end of the year,"" Nerayoff said Monday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" __ While bitcoin was designed to function as a peer to peer electronic payment system, ethereum was designed for smart contracts that execute when specific conditions are met. Nerayoff, who helped craft token sales for the ethereum project, said businesses in an increasingly wide variety of industries are starting to take note of what value Ethereum's protocol could offer them. __ ""You're seeing a tremendous amount of growth across a wide variety of industries. Fintech is actually the natural area, but now you're seeing it becoming increasingly more creative — you find projects in the oil and gas industry, you're finding government using it in their applications, you're seeing it in gaming, all kinds of different areas,"" Nerayoff said. __ Beyond project building, Nerayoff said usage is increasing because ethereum can process transactions more quickly and cheaply than its rival. __ ""People are actually using it for currency, as well,"" he said. ""Lower transactional costs are increasing usage of the entire network, and that's increasing the network effects of it. There are more users, more projects being built on there and more programmers,"" he said. __ Despite his confidence, Nerayoff isn't discounting bitcoin and the interest in cryptocurrency it inspired in 2017.  __ ""The entire space is increasing. There is huge interest by the public and  there are more areas in which the public can invest, even in bitcoin, so you could just see an expansion in the entire space,"" he said. __ Either way, when it comes to 2018, Nerayoff thinks ethereum is going to have a good year. __ On the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange, bitcoin closed down 8.73 percent at $14,766.86, with a market cap of $248 billion. __ Ethereum had an estimated $110 billion market cap at close. __  __ Playing __ Share this video... __ Watch Next..."

Growing your business, obtaining improved terms on financing, leveraging technology more effectively, and dealing with looming tax issues are certainly top of mind. It's easy to feel overwhelmed, and even become distracted from your bottom line, but at the end of the day your income and cash flow are what drive your business forward. __ Adding to this whirlwind of news and topics is all of the buzz and attention that trends like Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain tools are receiving. Those tools and trends are great, but they're still developing and might not be a good fit for your business now, or ever. Compounding this, learning new tools and technology can occupy a lot of your time, but there are ways you can help your business without investing endless hours. __ Taxes, technology, and leveraging social media effectively are important, but let's take a look at some ways you can improve your top to bottom. The best part? These won't bust your budget, or distract you from running and growing your business. __ The upsides of automation are, surely, clear to you as it pertains to both you and your business, but a question I'm asked quite often is where exactly to start? Three areas that I tend to focus on automating are __ Keeping your business secure, including both client data and inventory, is always a hot topic, but recent information and changes have arguably made this even more important. Ransomware, data breaches, and other cybersecurity risks can clearly compromise your business, but don't forget about traditional security measures. __ According to a 2017 study by the National Retail Federation, total losses due to retail shrinkage is approximately $60 billion, with 36.5 percent of that total driven by shoplifting. This is not something you can ignore, and just hope for the best. __ Making sure your inventory is organized, installing mirrors to improve your visibility, and putting cameras into place may take a little time, but will pay dividends now and in the future.   __ You should be able to articulate and speak about your numbers, like revenues, profit margins, cash flow figures, and cost of goods sold off the top of your head. Accounting and finance might not seem like the most enjoyable way to spend some of your valuable time, but even if you have a great CPA you need to put the time in. __ No one is going to be as interested in your business success as you are. Finance topics to focus on, on top of basic financial statement information, include but aren't limited to the following: __ Improving your business, and your bottom line, doesn't have to break the bank nor occupy every spare second of your free time. Thinking about your business from a high level, and taking some time to address issues that can have the biggest impact on your profits, are great ways to set yourself up for success in 2018."

39,Ada Ivanova,https://www.maketecheasier.com/get-started-mine-bitcoins/,2018-01-08T22:25:34Z,How to Get Started in Bitcoin Mining And Making a Profit,"login to view your favorites! __  Ada Ivanova  8th Jan 2018  How Things Work   No Comments __ With all the craze around Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies recently, it wouldn’t be surprising if you are also looking to get involved in it. Some of you might just want to buy and trade Bitcoins and make a profit, while others might want to go the mining route to earn Bitcoins. If you are the latter and are looking for a head start, in a nutshell, this will show you how to mine Bitcoins. __ Before we go into the details, let’s clarify what Bitcoin mining is. According to the Bitcoin wiki, “Mining is the process of adding transaction records to Bitcoin’s public ledger of past transactions.” In laymen’s terms, you use your computer (or other device) to do complex computations and get paid in bitcoins as a reward. __  __ The amount you make depends on your “hash rate” (the speed at which your machine processes transactions) and the difficulty of the tasks. As task difficulty rises over time, you need more and more powerful machine(s) to mine Bitcoins. __ With Bitcoin mining there are two approaches – buy your own hardware or buy a mining contract from a cloud miner. Buying a contract is easier and cheaper initially because you don’t have to throw thousands of dollars into your own hardware, but you have no physical control over the machine, and there are really a lot of scammers out there. __  __ There are contracts for $1 or $2 a day and also contracts for thousands of dollars a month – it all depends on what processing power you purchase. The main risk here is that if the provider is a scammer, you end with neither bitcoins nor the fee you paid. __ If you decide bitcoin mining contracts are not worth it for you and becoming your own miner makes sense, here is what you need to do. __ Long gone are the days when you could use just an ordinary PC to successfully mine coins. With the increased difficulty and competition from other miners, using just an ordinary PC is useless because it’s almost certain you will pay more for electricity than you will earn. Additionally, mining is pretty resource-intensive, and it’s quite possible you will burn your PC. __  __ In order to mine bitcoins, you need dedicated hardware. You can create your own mining rigs or buy a dedicated miner, such as the AntMiner series. When you are choosing mining hardware, you should care mostly about its price per hash and its electricity consumption. You can get miners for as low as $500, but basically the more expensive ones are more feasible if you are serious about Bitcoin mining. __  __ After you get the Bitcoin mining hardware, you need software. The most popular programs are open source and free. If a command line doesn’t scare you, you can get CGminer or BFGminer. If you prefer GUIs, check EasyMiner. __  __ If you don’t have a Bitcoin wallet by now, create one. You need a wallet in order to receive your payments. You can go with a free online wallet, such as SpectroCoin or CoinSpace, a software wallet you store on your computer, a paper wallet, or a hardware wallet for max security. If you are new to Bitcoin, start with a free online wallet and then move to more advanced wallets. __ While you can mine on your own, you can earn more if you become a “worker” with a Bitcoin mining pool. As with wallets, there are hundreds of pools to choose from, and I can’t recommend a single best one. I hear that BitMinter and SlushPool are two of the better ones, but don’t take this for granted, check it out on your own. __  __ Bitcoin mining certainly isn’t easy (or cheap) these days, but if you are serious about it and are willing to take risks, it could be a really profitable activity. In any case, be prepared to lose some money – it might not happen, but don’t count on it. Actually, it might turn out it’s cheaper to buy coins on the market rather than mine them, and it’s best if you make your profitability estimates before you buy the mining equipment. __ Are you tired of using Windows or OS X as your operating system and thinking of trying out, and possibly switching, to Linux?

The trepidations about investing that lingered long after the global financial crisis and market crash of 2008-09 have finally disappeared. The traffic jams at online brokers TD Direct Investing and RBC Direct Investing last week are less a story about technology issues than they are of investors acting on a fear of missing out on hot sectors and markets. __ Some words of advice for the bullish hordes: Be careful out there. There's a fine line between confidence and hubris in investing. __ Story continues below advertisement __ Marijuana stocks have been a big contributor to the trading frenzy at online brokers, but the aggressive stance of investors lately is much broader than that. Mutual-fund industry statistics show that for the first 11 months as a whole last year, bond funds far outsold equity funds. But in November, the most recent month for which there are data, investors unloaded a net $478-million in bond funds and bought a net $940-million in equity funds. __ There are a few possible causes for this shift, starting with an accumulation of good stock market returns. The U.S. stock market has been a juggernaut in recent years and lately has been reaching new highs on a regular basis. The Canadian market hasn't been nearly as strong, but it still managed to add a 9.1-per-cent total return last year (share price change plus dividends) to the 21.1-per-cent jump in 2016. __ Adding a sense of urgency to these returns has been the attention lavished on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Their surge in value has arguably made them as much a part of popular culture as internet stocks were back in the late 1990s. People see the money made in bitcoin and it motivates them to find their own winning investment. __ For those who find bitcoin too obscure to invest in, there are plenty of choices if you want some action. Marijuana stocks have been energized by the plan to legalize cannabis in Canada by July, 2018. Canopy Growth Corp. (WEED), a leader in the sector, was up 248 per cent for the 12 months to Jan. 5. The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF (HMMJ), an exchange-traded fund that track an index of marijuana stocks, has increased 86 per cent in price in the past month. __ Even the old standby sectors favoured by aggressive investors are hot. The materials sector – basically mining – was the second-ranked performer among the subindexes of the S&P/TSX composite index in the past month, with energy next. The weakest performers have been classic defensive sectors – telecom services, utilities and consumer staples, the latter being the second-best performing sector over the past five years. __ TD Direct Investing reports unprecedented levels of investor activity last week – double the trading volumes of a year earlier, and triple the level of overall client activity. Online brokerage firms get overwhelmed when investors get cocky. The same thing happened in 1999-2000, as tech stocks entered their final epic surge before a market crash. __ There's a correct way for mainstream investors to trade hot stocks and sectors. Quarantine your speculative investments – don't let them mix with your investments for retirement or your children's postsecondary education. Speculate with money you can afford to lose, and be mentally prepared for a loss. In fact, be prepared to lose everything at worst. __ Story continues below advertisement __ Story continues below advertisement __ The broader trend of more aggressive investing may actually be a modestly good thing. It's true that the stock markets haven't had a serious correction in ages. People selling bonds to buy stocks right now are definitely late to the party. But bear markets tend to be triggered by recessions and global economic growth shows signs of strength right now. __ Interest rates are starting to trend higher, but they remain too low to generate the gains many investors will need to reach their financial goals. For the long-term investor, a shift of a limited amount of money from bonds to stocks could be sensible in that light. __ Something all investors should bear in mind right now is that the ability to understand risk suffers when there's a lot of enthusiasm about strong markets, sectors and stocks. The big risk right now seems to be missing out, but that's wrong. Losses hurt more than gains feel good. __  Latest Videos  __ © Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail Inc.

42,IOTA SUPPORTER,https://hackernoon.com/iota-possible-bosch-usecases-bc0ebbce77d3,2018-01-08T22:18:47Z,IOTA: possible BOSCH usecases,"As we have seen already, BOSCH Venture Capital has bought a “significant amount of IOTA tokens”. Although “a bigger unveil (one of the IOTA partnerships)” at the CES had been postponed, it was still interesting to watch BOSCH’s tweets from their press conference: This article tries to show why IOTA’s technology perfectly fits in the company’s plans. __ Note: This has not been confirmed by the IOTA Foundation, it’s just my own thoughts so please consider it as such. __ Bosch is one of the biggest and most advanced companies within the realm of vehicle parts suppliers and IoT: __ As the European Patent Organisation confirmed for 2016 (more recent numbers are not available at the time of writing), BOSCH has the most granted patents of all European patentees: __ Bosch’s own focus these days is on the three S: __ As one of the executives said at the CES in Las Vegas: __ Interestingly enough, this seems a perfect match for IOTA’s capabilities (that’s why BOSCH invested in it, of course). Yet the question remains what BOSCH could do with? __ Smart cities will be huge topic in the near future, BOSCH’s tweet says it all: __ Las Vegas alone has announced a plan to invest $500m over the next seven years smart city infrastructure. In Bay area a beacon project has been launched which is supposed to save over $8m across 15 years simply by using 5000 smart street lights. __ Furthermore it was stated that by 2020 all electronic products will be web-enabled. As you can imagine, this will result in a incredible amount of data that will be set free. IOTA’s scaling capabilities and speed enable it to be the base-layer of all these transactions of information. In the following, I shall give an overview of some usecases which could technically be done using IOTA infrastructure. __ The idea here is to analyze the air quality, humidity and pollen concentration in order to improve the overall quality by putting measures into place if necessary. The product to gather the information is already working and has received the CES 2018 Innovation Award: The Climo. __ Of course, the collected data can be “faked”, for example by positioning the boxes in a very “green/healthy” part of the city. However, the idea is to collect data from so many points that the overall number of information sources will prevent biased results. Moreover, you could also only focus on a specific area of the city in order to compare the data to other parts of the city. __ IOTA’s tangle would be the layer on which all of these information pieces are exchanged. To make this clearer: Imagine hundreds of Climos in Las Vegas sending their data every second to the IOTA market place = real time information. A sophisticated blockchain might be able to handle this, agreed. And such a blockchain might come up with a marketplace, agreed. But what if hundreds of thousands of residents buy the technology for their own roof because they want to make good money by selling the data to air-quality-improving-companies’ R&D branches? Right, that’s hundreds of Climos +hundreds of thousands homes sending their data every second over a public ledger! And this is why IOTA is needed because it offers the speed, the scalabilty and it has no transaction fees! __ Have you ever been in a city trying desperately to find a parking spot? BOSCH thought about this problem and their solution is simply brilliant: __ Watch this short video to get the idea: __ Again, this is a lot of data: Every car sensors possible parking spots, transmits the data in real-time and the exact same data needs to be transfered to all the cars looking for a parking spot. Of course, this could be perfectly combined with self-driving vehicles: You just hop off at the store where you want to go, the car finds itself a spot to wait (or is used for other purposes in the meantime) and comes back to you once you are done. __ This sounds rather futuristic and utopian, but BOSCH has already equipped 1.5m cars with their IoT software. 20 US cities (such as Miami, LA and Boston) will offer this amazing technology in 2018! __ Again, this is so much data be produced for one city alone — but if it is successful, the whole world will want this technology and that means an incredible amount of data which needs to be processed. __ One could also imagine a usecase like this: Before starting your trip in the car you reserve a free parking spot for a certain amount and can be sure to get this one (e.g. right in front of your destination). The possibilities are endless! __ I think you got the gist so far: It’s a lot of information which can be used (if processed in real-time) to help individuals have a better/smarter/… life. The following are just some ideas how the technology can help us and each of these usecases would perfectly be doable using IOTA’s tangle as a base-layer: __ You might ask: Fine, nice tech — but BOSCH using IOTA would need a working product by now? You are right, and this product really exits: the XDK. It is a small developer kit which collects various data (for example from machines) for later analysis: __ Dominik Schiener, Co-founder of IOTA, introduced how IOTA’s technology works on this kit: __ So BOSCH is apparently really interested in IOTA’s capabilities. __ These ideas are being made real as you are reading this. Of course, BOSCH is not the only company doing this. And since there are many others trying to make money establishing this kind of technology in countless industries: Yet neither consumers nor the companies want a different solution for each industry (imagine different standards among TVs and each producer would have to follow different sets of rules for different standards; we had this problem once between BluRay and HD-DVD; there could only be one…). So the question remains: What will be the standard protocol in IoT/Industry 4.0 to transfer and process all this data? In my opinion, there is only one candidate which offers everything that is needed: __ And guess what? The only existing tech out there offering each of these is IOTA even if it only at a rather early stage of its development. The time of thousands of cryptocurrencies is ending(95% of which are just copycats of Bitcoin without real usecases) — 2018 will be the year of real-world adoption and nobody is better prepared for this than IOTA (for more information in this regard read my previous articles (more than 60,000 views within a week!). __ If you want to, I would be happy about a little donation ;-): __ IOTA: KGOZYHJRYVDBSXTUSECYJVEBLDVYFKCAKAWTPTCKXMBNOWNVRDRHRVSJNIVOQUFRODFPXWYSGROKRWKRZWJZTJOHSX __ By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. __ Hey. I’m German and I have started writing about IOTA on New Year’s Day 2018 — I cannot code but writing is my way of supporting this great project of IOTA! __ how hackers start their afternoons."

Dive deep into blockchain development. Subscribe Now __ Staff writer __ Starting on Monday, January 8, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. GMT, the ADA token from Cardano began to be listed on the futures exchange at BitMEX. __ This makes BitMEX the fifth exchange to list the ADA token since Bittrex did so in October 2017, followed by Upbit, Binance and Coinnest.  __ Cardano, a project of IOHK, was designed by leading experts in academics and cryptography over the last couple years and draws from various features of existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ripple and Ethereum, but uses a proof-of-stake/security model as opposed to proof of work.  __ Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK, said: “As markets evolve, there is an increasing need for liquidity and more sophisticated trading strategies. I’m glad to see BitMEX list ADA and hope this continues to aid our march towards becoming the financial stack for the developing world.” __ Cardano is a full blockchain, built from scratch in the functional programming language Haskell. At the heart of Cardano lies Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Ouroboros comes with a mathematical proof of security that has undergone a rigorous peer review, resulting in its acceptance and presentation at the major cryptography conference Crypto 2017.  __ News broke last week that GRNET, the national research and education network of Greece, is working on a pilot project to verify student diplomas on Cardano, signifying a first official use case for the Cardano blockchain. __ The chairman of the Cardano Foundation, Michael Parsons, said: “This new listing is indicative of Cardano becoming a truly global blockchain platform. We are excited to see Cardano list with BitMEX. Adoption of ADA by new trading platforms is reflective of the bright future that Cardano has as a leading blockchain platform.” __ The BitMEX listing of ADA is a form of fixed-date contract that allows traders to speculate on the changing value of the ADA/XBT exchange rate with a leverage of up to 20 times. It is not required for traders to have ADA to trade the contract; it only requires bitcoin as a margin. Full details are available on the BitMEX site here. __ Thank you!

Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, which went live around 2009. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to transact as an open source community network, without an official leader or administrator. __  So far it is the most widespread, most secure and has the most diverse participants out of all the cryptocurrencies. According to CoinMarketCap, by Monday bitcoin’s global market cap was worth more than $247 billion.  It is possible to argue litecoin and monero are the two altcoins, aka alternative coins, that are most similar to bitcoin. __  They have grassroots contributors that cooperate with nonprofit foundations without taking direction from them. Both the bitcoin and litecoin communities are experimenting with something called the Lightning Network, which creates a whole new layer for unprecedented features and cross-chain transactions. __  It will be a long time until this scaling solution is really implemented on the bitcoin network.  In the meantime, the important thing to remember about altcoins is they are not all bitcoin “rivals.” Litecoin and bitcoin have a symbiotic relationship. Some tokens serve very different functions altogether. __  There is no beef between monero and bitcoin, only between a few individual fans who may get in fights on social media. To the contrary, cryptocurrency communities often overlap and learn from each other.

 __ Reuters __ SEOUL – A cybersecurity company said it has found software that appears to install code for mining cryptocurrency and sends any mined coins to a server at a North Korean university, the latest sign that North Korea may be searching for new ways to infuse its economy with cash. __ The application, which was created on Dec. 24, uses host computers to mine a cryptocurrency called Monero. It then sends any coins to Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, said cybersecurity firm AlienVault, which examined the program. __ 
 __ “Crypto-currencies may provide a financial lifeline to a country hit hard by sanctions, and as a result universities in Pyongyang have shown a clear interest in cryptocurrencies,” the California-based security firm said in a release, adding that the software “may be the most recent product of their endeavours.” __ The company added a caveat that a North Korean server used in the code does not appear to be connected to the wider internet, which could mean its inclusion is meant to trick observers into making a North Korean connection. Kim Il Sung University, however, plays host to foreign students and lecturers, not just North Koreans. __ Kim Il Sung University did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Government officials representing North Korea at the United Nations were not immediately available for comment. __ Others have flagged increasing signs of North Korean interest in cryptocurrencies and underlying blockchain technology. __ “With economic sanctions in place, cryptocurrencies are currently the best way to earn foreign currency in North Korea’s situation. It is hard to trace and can be laundered several times,” said Mun Chong-hyun, chief analyst at South Korean cybersecurity firm ESTsecurity. __ Cryptocurrency watchers say technical details of Monero, the 13th-largest crypto asset in the world, according to www.coinmarketcap.com, with a total value of more than $7 billion, make it more appealing than bitcoin to those who value secrecy. __ Monero funds go to an unlinkable, one-time address generated with random numbers every time a payment is issued. That makes it less traceable than bitcoin, where transactions can be linked to specific, albeit anonymous, private addresses, cybersecurity experts said. __  __ LATEST BUSINESS STORIES __ South Korea-based Bithumb, the world’s busiest cryptocurrency exchange, is also the largest Monero trading exchange in the world, with about 24 percent of trading volume. The next largest were Europe-based exchange HitBTC and Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, as of Monday. __ Cybersecurity firm FireEye cited in a November blog post a series of North Korean activities against South Korean cryptocurrency targets such as exchanges. Analyst Luke McNamara wrote that “it should be no surprise that cryptocurrencies, as an emerging asset class, are becoming a target of interest by a regime that operates in many ways like a criminal enterprise.” __ In early November, Federico Tenga, the Italian co-founder of bitcoin startup Chainside, posted on his Twitter account pictures and comments on his visit to lecture on bitcoin and blockchain technology at the Western-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. __ “The lectures were at a quite basic level to give a general understanding of blockchain technologies, which are also very relevant to trade, supply chains and other e-business,” a spokesman for the university said. __ “We believe this teaching can give the next generation of North Korean professionals additional concepts that may be valuable as they seek to develop their country,” the spokesman added. “We’re acutely aware of issues around sanctions, which we keep under regular review and take care to avoid any sensitive or proscribed areas.” __ Tenga said his lectures were geared toward explaining the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies. __ “The focus of the lectures was to make the students understand what the blockchain is, how it works (special focus on proof of work) and what are the main use cases. My aim was simply to spread technical knowledge, not suggesting them how to use it,” Tenga told Reuters in a series of messages. __ AlienVault’s report said one North Korean IP address, 175.45.178.19, has been active on bitcoin trading sites. That is the same address used to control compromised web servers in 2014-15 cyberattacks on South Korean energy, traffic, telecommunications, broadcasting, financial and political institutions, according to security firm AhnLab. __ The report also observed that North Korean IP addresses have downloaded several episodes of the automotive TV series Top Gear and documentaries by the show’s former presenter James May. __

55,newsfeedback@fool.com (Dan Caplinger),https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/01/08/why-tesla-weight-watchers-international-and-seagat.aspx,2018-01-08T21:31:00Z,"Why Tesla, Weight Watchers International, and Seagate Technology Jumped Today","Returns as of 3/18/2018 __ Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. __ Returns as of 3/18/2018 __ Monday continued the positive string of stock market performances for 2018, as major benchmarks largely bounced back from losses early in the session to finish with modest gains. Sentiment among investors has been extremely high to start the year, helping to spur advances but also raising concerns that exuberance on Wall Street might be reaching irrational levels. Nevertheless, good news affecting key individual companies helped to support market indexes, and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Weight Watchers International (NYSE:WTW), and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well. __ Shares of Tesla picked up 6%, bouncing back from subpar performance last week as investors regained confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's ability to capitalize on a lucrative market opportunity. Last week, Tesla disappointed investors when it announced fourth-quarter vehicle delivery numbers that included fewer-than-expected Model 3 deliveries. Yet the company argued that focusing on quality and efficiency was smarter than simply getting production numbers up, and although it took a few days, shareholders seemed eventually to buy into that argument. With potential not only for the Model 3 but also battery production and other groundbreaking innovations, Tesla still captures the imagination of forward-looking enthusiasts -- even if some say its stock price has already gotten ahead of itself. __ Image source: Tesla. __ Shares of Weight Watchers International climbed 12% after investors responded positively to a speech given by company spokesperson and major shareholder Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globe Awards Sunday night. Winfrey has denied that she intends to run in the 2020 presidential election, but some believe that she might change her mind in the next couple of years. Given that Weight Watchers has now identified itself very closely with Winfrey, many shareholders are tying the futures of the two together. Investors still need to watch fundamental business performance at this key time of the year for the weight-loss business, but publicity linked to Winfrey could help gain attention for Weight Watchers. __ Finally, shares of Seagate Technology rose 7%. The data-storage specialist became the latest stock to jump in response to cryptocurrency fever, as rumors surfaced that Seagate might have a significant position in the company behind the rising crypto play Ripple. The website for the cryptocurrency company identified Seagate as an early investor in past rounds of capital raising, although it doesn't state whether Seagate retained its interest. Ripple has recently challenged ethereum for the No. 2 spot behind bitcoin in terms of total market value of outstanding coin, with dramatic gains in 2017 that dwarfed what the other two cryptocurrencies produced. Yet without confirmation, any gains from speculation could easily reverse themselves once the facts come out. __  __ Dan Caplinger has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

After all, Ivanka is apparently still trundling around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, yet how would she know? __ More to the point, the Donald doesn’t have the Deep State and its collaborators in the media and among the Dems and establishment Republicans lathered-up in a Salem-style witch-hunt hysteria because he’s stupid. What he is is reckless, impetuous, undisciplined, glandular, petty, megalomaniacal, mendacious and uninformed—–and also in so deep over his head that even his signature orange comb-over will soon be fading from sight. __ Yet there is something about Michael Wolff’s tirade that deeply resonates, albeit on the other end of the Acela Corridor. __ We are referring, of course, to the “idiots” who are buying the S&P 500 at 2735 and earnestly debating the pros and cons of bitcoin at $16,000; and to the “boys and girls” (nee “children”) on Wall Street who have a hissy fit every time Washington—either via its central banking branch or statutory and fiscal tools—-even vaguely mutters about financial discipline or eventually cutting off all the fiscal and monetary free-stuff. __ This morning, in fact, we heard one of the street’s permabulls describing the current madness as a state of stock market “nirvana” that will carry the S&P average to 3,100 in the near future. __ That’s right. While that particular figure would equate to 29X LTM earnings for the S&P 500 and about 150X for the Russell 2000, it makes no never mind. __ That’s because we have reached the ultra-FOMO (fear of missing out) stage of the bubble mania, where the only thing that matters is the price action. That is, what is being bought in the casino is what is going up, and for the sole reason that it is going up. __   __ Traditional Tar, Feathers, Horsewhipping, and a ride out of town on a rail for that fat lip mouthed POS is in order."

Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. __ Two of the biggest names in financial markets are sounding warnings against complacency in the global economic outlook.  After strong data and multiple stock-market records in the first week of 2018, Citigroup Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co. told clients over the past few days that there are still reasons to be worried. While both agree there are causes for optimism, they cite geopolitical factors, a removal of central bank stimulus and the risk of an inflation overshoot as possible catalysts for an end to the current economic expansion and market exuberance. Investors are showing few signs of unease with global stocks at record highs and volatility measures still subdued. __ South Korean officials face a delicate task at 10a.m. Seoul time today, when they meet their North Korean counterparts for the first time in more than two years. The meeting at a village on their shared border will focus on North Korea’s participation at next month’s Winter Olympics in the South Korean mountain resort of Pyeongchang. But there’s much more at stake. After a tumultuous year in which Kim Jong Un’s regime accelerated its nuclear weapons program and U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to strike back with “fire and fury,” it’s an opportunity to ease tensions — and possibly open the door to peace talks.  __ Bitcoin slumped Monday, dragging down smaller rivals such as ether and litecoin, as concerns that regulators will tighten their grip on the market weigh on the the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Regulators in China and South Korea are increasing oversight on cryptocurrency trading and mining, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late last year started cracking down on some digital token sales, known as ICOs. These actions are spurring speculation demand in the biggest markets for digital assets may wane. The rout in bitcoin is part of a broader selloff in the cryptocurrency realm, with all of the top 10 by market cap falling, and most tumbling by at least 10 percent, according to Coinmarketcap.com. __ China’s first sovereign dollar bond in more than a decade has done poorly for investors who scrambled to get a piece of the rare offering amid overwhelming demand. The tight pricing of the bonds, lauded by China’s finance ministry, has had a lot to do with it, according to analysts. The $2 billion securities sold in late October handed investors a 0.73 percent loss in the last two months of 2017, one of the few Asian nations that saw their government bonds generate negative returns during the period. In a bid to serve as a benchmark for the nation’s surging dollar-denominated corporate bond market, China’s government priced its debentures at a lower premium than that of South Korea, which is rated two steps higher by S&P Global Ratings. The effect proved short-lived as spreads on state-owned company bonds, which compressed leading up to the offering, have reversed the gains since the sovereign bonds were sold. __ Asian equities are poised to open in the green after U.S. stocks turned higher in afternoon trading. Technology shares once again bolstered major indexes, as investors continue to price in the impact of tax cuts before corporate earnings start later in the week. It's a light day for data out of Asia, with Japan  November labor cash earnings the standout. Bloomberg Economics expects a 0.8% year-on-year rise, up from 0.2% in October. __ This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours. __ — With assistance by Camila Russo, David Goodman, Lianting Tu, and David Tweed"

The CFTC’s report looks at trading activity from the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which launched bitcoin futures contracts on December 10, 2017.  __ The Wall Street Journal, which analyzed the data, reports that bullish bets are 3.6 times more likely as compared to bearish calls among investors (or, retail investors) who held fewer than 25 CBOE bitcoin futures contracts. In contrast, institutional investors are 2.6 times more likely to place a short bet on bitcoin as compared to short calls. Bitcoin’s downward trajectory in the last week has provided further ammunition to money manager skeptics to double down on short bets. The CFTC’s Commitment Of Traders report states that institutional money placed 40% more short bets than long bets last week.  __ But the preponderance of shorts among institutional investors does not necessarily mean bad news for its prospects. For starters, it might represent a hedging strategy against a decline in prices for a firm that has a significant stake in bitcoin.  __ The Journal also states that shorting could be part of “sophisticated trading strategies” to profit off altcoins, which have surged in price even as bitcoin has crashed in value. But the chances of that occurrence in bitcoin futures are few. This is because the volumes of bitcoin futures trading are too low to make a difference to the cryptocurrency’s price.  __  __ For example, the total volume of trading in the bitcoin futures market was approximately $150 million. Bitcoin touched a high of $297.1 billion in market capitalization that day. Retail investors comprise a majority of the unregulated spot exchange markets. The Journal’s report quotes Steven Sanders, an executive vice president at  Interactive Brokers Group Inc., as saying that there is “more optimism” in the retail segment as compared to the institutional category. (See also: Four Problems With Bitcoin Futures.)  __ When they were launched, bitcoin futures contracts were expected to bring price stability to spot exchanges for the cryptocurrency. But low trading volumes coupled with high margin requirements and hesitation from institutional investors has proved to be a bottleneck for more investment. That said, the price difference between futures markets for bitcoin and its spot exchanges has shrunk in recent times.

It’s certainly the first of its kind to make it big, and is by far the most recognizable of these unprecedented investment opportunities. Up and comer Ripple is just a little bit behind first place at this point in terms of market cap, however. At this point, it’s a battle of Ripple vs Bitcoin when it comes to determining which currency will dominate in 2018. __  __ While the current price of a Ripple coin is only a few dollars, the battle of Ripple vs Bitcoin is actually pretty close due to the sheer amount of the former currency available. While Bitcoin costs tens of thousands of dollars for a single coin, CNBC reports that there are almost 39 billion cheap Ripple coins in circulation. At the price of $2.49 earlier today, the second place currency would only have to rise 160% to make the Ripple vs Bitcoin battle incredibly close. That seems like a tough goal to make, but considering that Ripple climbed almost 36000 percent last year, it’s definitely within reach. The currency just needs to reach $6.57 to surpass the current king of cryptocurrency – at least in terms of the market cap. __ Bitcoin has run into its share of problems recently, with a large crash following some disappointing news from the governments of China and Israel. As a cryptocurrency trailblazer, Bitcoin is running into issues establishing itself as a legitimate investment opportunity. A recently leaked document suggests China will soon crack down on Bitcoin, and the Israeli government doesn’t consider the currency a legitimate form of payment. With no real-world basis for the rise and fall of its prices – such as the performance of a company with traditional stocks – all cryptocurrencies have dealt with at least some sort of volatility. In the case of Bitcoin, the changes have been drastic. Down to almost $15000 from a high of near $20000 in the last couple of weeks, it’s becoming clear that even a currency as large as Bitcoin has the potential to crash and burn. For this reason, it’s possible that its competitor could come out on top in the battle of Ripple vs Bitcoin. __ Although a 160% jump is definitely feasible for Ripple, they may have their share of competition from rival currency Ethereum. Both cryptocurrencies have fluctuated between second and third place in terms of market cap, so this Ripple vs Bitcoin battle could actually end up as Ethereum vs Bitcoin. As cryptocurrencies are still uncharted territory for many investors, there’s no telling what the situation could be like a few years – or even a few months – down the line. __ By design, Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins. With over 16 million coins currently in circulation, it’s becoming harder and harder to mine new coins and it’s very difficult for the lead currency to significantly change the market cap. Ripple comes out on top when comparing Ripple vs Bitcoin in terms of available currency, with billions rather than millions of available coins. A minor jump or fall with Ripple – or competitor Ethereum – is far more impactful than a small fluctuation in a coin that costs thousands per unit. __ Still, the Ripple vs Bitcoin battle is anything but a sure win for the newer currency, considering how rapidly Bitcoin rose in the last few weeks of 2017. The extreme volatility of the market makes it difficult to make any accurate predictions regarding either currency. Investment experts had to continually revise their estimates for Bitcoin throughout the year due to unprecedented growth, and many people expected the meteoric rise to continue into the new year. That didn’t happen, however, with 2018 heralding a massive crash. But that’s certainly no indication that the currency won’t recover, and the Ripple vs Bitcoin battle rages on – with the former constantly threatened by Ethereum. The fact of the matter is that both cryptocurrencies are relatively new, despite the fact that Bitcoin is rapidly heading towards maxing out the maximum possible coins. Whether the Ripple vs Bitcoin situation becomes a little more predictable as time goes on remains to be seen, but right now the outcome is anyone’s guess. __   __

Bitcoin values also fell roughly 7.6% to $15,000, while Ethereum prices rose slightly, 2.5% to $1,155. That pushed Ripple’s market capitalization down to $98.5 billion, and lifted Ethereum’s value to $111.9 billion, according to data firm CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin, meanwhile, maintains its top spot with a valuation of $255.1 billion. __ It was a hodge podge of news Monday that helped shape those shifting dynamics. For one, reports have emerged that the Chinese government, home to the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operation, would push for an “orderly exit” from the cryptocurrency mining business, Quartz reported. __ Then, CoinMarketCap, a major source of information in the crypto world, decided to remove data from South Korean exchanges in its calculation of asset prices. Since cryptocurrency generally trades higher in South Korea, the removal looked like a sudden across-the-board sell off—triggering panicked selling from investors who were not immediately made aware of the change. __ “First, it was due to capital flows with investors realizing their profits from cryptocurrencies,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at cryptocurrency brokerage eToro in an email to Fortune. “Secondly, a data adjustment by CoinMarketCap, the most popular site for cryptocurrency pricing data, removed South Korean exchanges from its site, which have been known to trade much higher than the rest of the world.” __ This morning we excluded some Korean exchanges in price calculations due to the extreme divergence in prices from the rest of the world and limited arbitrage opportunity.  We are working on better tools to provide users with the averages that are most relevant to them. __ — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) January 8, 2018 __  __ While the execution left something to be wanted, the exclusion of South Korean markets seemed logically sound to some cryptocurrency watchers, including Ripple Chief Cryptographer David Schwartz. __ They are outliers due to a shortage of cryptos in Korea and difficulty getting KRW out. The new price is more accurate and meaningful, IMO. __ — David Schwartz (@JoelKatz) January 8, 2018 __  __ Ripple’s price, which rose as high as $3.65 last week, may have gotten an extra push southward after the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase quashed rumors that it might allow trading of Ripple in the near future. __ “As of the date of this statement, we have made no decision to add additional assets to either GDAX or Coinbase,” a Coinbase representative wrote in a Jan. 4 post. “Any statement to the contrary is untrue and not authorized by the company.” __ That dispelled hopes that Ripple would be exposed to even more investors, namely, those on Coinbase. __ At the same time, investors have also been worrying as to whether Ripple is in bubble territory. The asset has jumped 900% in the past month alone."

Jon Shazar  __ Consider the career of one Keith Noreika. At the beginning of the year, in addition to celebrating the ascent of a patently unfit lunatic to the highest office in the land, he was doing what he had done for the better part of two decades: representing giant banks. As such, there could have been no better choice for President Trump’s first bank regulator appointment. Now, whether the White House thought that Noreika was even more toxic than the guy they formally appointed to the job, Comptroller of the Currency, or whether Noreika was just doing his buddy Don a solid after serving on his transition team, is unclear. Either way, starting in May, Noreika was Acting Comptroller. And was he ever: __ He was a provocative comptroller, questioning the policies of his predecessors, unilaterally rolling back rules, and displaying a “Make America Great Again” cap in his office. __ He approved the first new national bank charter since the financial crisis, eased criteria for evaluating banks’ performance in serving lower-income communities, and rescinded guidance that had banned banks from offering short-term, high-cost loans—all areas where he could advise future clients. __ All the while gleefully ignoring the rule that said, on account of his being a temporary government employee not subject to Senate approval, he could only do all of that rule-shredding for 130 days, which 130 days expired either on Sept. 12 or sometime in October, depending on how you count. No matter: Noreika just continued comptrolling the currency until Steve Mnuchin’s muscle was formally confirmed in the post in November. __ And now, as if to further punctuate that we now live in a world without rules or the concept of a conflict of interest, here’s what Noreika is doing: __ Mr. Noreika will once again be a partner at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, occupying the same office in Washington that he vacated to take the job of interim comptroller in May 2017…. __ He said he looks forward to helping banks navigate regulations and weighing in on debates about how new financial innovations, from bitcoin to online lending startups, should be regulated. “If people want my advice, I’m happy for it,” he said. __ Former Trump Bank Regulator Returns to Law Firm [WSJ] __ Keith Noreika, law, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, simpson thacher, whatevs __ #draintheswamp

Spreading the truth. Empowering the people.
 __ 
Josh Sigurdson talks with author and economic analyst John Sneisen about the recent warning from Morgan Stanley that we’ll likely see a correction in global stocks this year.
The bank recently sold off all of their junk bond holdings and the CIO Mike Wilson said this,
“While the tax cuts just enacted in the U.S. may lead to better growth in the short term, they may also bring forth the excesses we typically see before a recession — which is something credit markets figure out before equities.” As a result “we recently took our remaining high yield positions to zero as we prepare for deterioration in lower-quality earnings in the U.S. led by lower operating margins.”
He went on to say,
“investors should prepare for at least one correction in global stocks this year.”
Now this is happening as bubbles continue to gain pressure across the board and market manipulation meets its inevitable end.
While everything seems great, we’re seeing an uneducated euphoria that we’ve seen far too many times before leading up to a crash.
People are flocking into decentralized assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as gold and silver. This is a sign of a coming storm as individual demand moves closer towards freedom and further away from centralized manipulation.
Stay tuned as we continue to break these issues down!

							16 Money Mistakes Millennials Don’t Realize They’re Making						 __ Get a print subscription to Reader's Digest and instantly enjoy free digital access on any device. __ Next: Provide address & payment __ Africa Studio/shutterstock There are costly money mistakes we all make. For Millennials, who were born into a recession and watched their parents struggle with credit, one of those mistakes is avoiding credit. A 2016 Bankrate survey found that less than one-third of Millennials have a credit card account, compared to over half of consumers above age 30. They tend to believe debit or cash transactions are a safer alternative, but they may not be the best bet in the long term. __ ""Ignoring credit entirely will produce a limited credit profile,"" warns Financial Advisor Michael Zaino. ""When you do need credit for larger purchases such as a home or a car, lenders will have no way to evaluate your risk. You'll have more trouble getting a loan and will likely pay higher interest for the unknown risk that you present."" __ Zaino, founder of TZG Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina, practices what he preaches. ""The day my daughter turned 18, I got her a credit card and taught her how to responsibly use it. I also made sure she was listed on the loan I took out for her car so that her credit would build while she was in college, giving her a head start on life."" Here are 11 easy ways to improve your credit score today. __ DomDew Studio/Shutterstock __ On the positive side, Millennials do tend to invest—but, according to a survey from AMG Funds, stocks make up only 30 percent of the average Millennial's portfolio. That's almost one-third below the equity holdings of the average older investor. __ Zaino, who counsels the Millennial children and grandchildren of his primary client base, says, ""Younger investors who can't handle the risk associated with stocks are missing out on significant long-term growth through higher returns and the positive effects of compounding interest. In addition, younger investors have more time to gain back any losses caused by market corrections or recessions. Being overtly risk-averse and not taking advantage of the upside potential is not the way to go."" __ WAYHOME studio/Shutterstock __ According to the Wall Street Journal, approximately 13 percent of student loan debt in the repayment stage is in default. Student loan default has long-lasting financial consequences since it generally can't be discharged in bankruptcy. __ While many graduates simply don't have the income to make their loan payments, others are downplaying their obligation or ignoring it entirely. Don't ignore the help that's available. Income-based repayment options and other forms of assistance are available through the Federal Student Aid website. Check out where your student loan money goes. __ RomanR/Shutterstock Freelance part-time jobs in the ""Gig Economy,"" such as Uber driving and finite contract work, appeal to Millennials who prefer to focus on lifestyle choices rather than optimizing income in a traditional career. However, this lifestyle requires discipline in money management, time management, and contract negotiation skills. A gig lifestyle can be very rewarding—if you are prepared for what it takes to make a freelance living. One of those things is paying estimated quarterly taxes. __ Millennials who start earning money as freelancers or independent contractors need to set aside funds for taxes on a federal and local level, depending on where they live and work. Without an employer to kick in their share, self-employed Millennials have to pay both halves of their Social Security tax! Zaino advises opening up a separate account and depositing at least 25 percent of those untaxed earnings into the account in order to avoid being caught in the unfavorable position of owing the government more than you can pay. __ And in case you're still wondering what to do when you grow up, these are the jobs with the happiest workers. __ Content continues below ad __ Arsenie Krasnevsky/Shutterstock __ Millennials may be debt-averse in general, but they are prone to lifestyle choices that can accrue significant debt in small increments. A recent survey from CompareCards.com by Lending Tree found that three of the five top expenses that create Millennial credit card debt were making ends meet, eating out, and clothes shopping. This suggests misplaced priorities and a lack of a reasonable budget (or an unwillingness to stick to one). Reports Zaino, ""I can't tell you how many young people I see who land a good job, or a bonus, and then go right out and finance a BMW or other luxury car. Millennials get a raise, and then upscale their house. Before they know it, they're drowning in debt trying to keep up with the Joneses, but what they don't realize is that the Joneses are broke!"" Read more about the study on CompareCards.com. Don't miss these tips on how to stick to a budget. __ alexkich/Shutterstock __ This is a biggie. ""Many Millennials are happy to spend now as opposed to saving for retirement since it's so far off in the distance,"" reports Zaino. ""But the longer you wait, the more you lose out on compound interest. There's a reason Albert Einstein called compound interest 'the Eighth Wonder of the World.' Those who understand compound interest and the way it works will earn it; those who don't will pay it. Plus,"" he adds, ""investing in tax-deferred retirement accounts could also minimize your current tax burden."" Try a Retirement Planner to see if you are on pace to retire without jeopardizing your lifestyle. __ And check out the things people wish they'd done for their retirement before it was too late. __ Andrey Popov/Shutterstock Lack of investment understanding can lead to unrealistic Millennial expectations. The AMG Funds survey found that Millennials expect an average return of 13.7 percent on their investments—well above the 7.7 percent expected by baby boomers. That's achievable, but it doesn't square with a portfolio that is light on equities. ""Millennials may have such high expectations since they haven't lived as an investor through down markets and fully experienced those negative effects,"" Zaino says. ""Combine that with the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and their expectations may be a bit skewed. They need to understand that just because you hear about a penny stock that has doubled in a month, it doesn't mean it's necessarily true or that it will happen for you."" __ Here are more money management tips every recent grad should know. __ Artur Begel/Shutterstock __ Besides not building credit, those who use debit cards are missing out on valuable credit card benefits, such as travel rewards and sign-up bonuses (here are some examples of when not to use your debit card). Says Zaino, ""Some cards, like the Capital One Venture card, give you double miles on everything. Other cards will give you cash back, but under restrictions.

4)  About $3 Trillion in deferred taxes is coming due on Baby Boomer 401k’s.  The higher the stock market, the more Uncle Sam collects through required distributions.
5)  With pensions being phased out, everyone with a retirement account will soon own a 401k. This includes 25 million government workers who previously relied on pensions alone. __ A stock market that goes up over time is not optional.  It's a requirement.

You evaluate the merits of an asset based on its financials, and then determine if the current price is worth paying. Unfortunately, the world of investing is rife with myths and urban legends that can detract investors from making the best decisions. One asset class that possibly has the most myths surrounding it is gold. It has been around for thousands of years, but we still haven't quite figured out how it fits best in an investment portfolio. __ We asked three Motley Fool investors to debunk an investing myth surrounding gold so you can make better decisions. Here's what they had to say. __ Image source: Getty Images. __ Tyler Crowe: A common investing belief is that gold is a good hedge against inflation. That means anytime there's a period of rising interest rates, investors should allocate capital to gold.  __ If you dig into the data, though, that investment hasn't gone as well as one might expect. Authors Robert Johnson and Luis Garcia-Feijoo of the book Invest with the Fed went through the returns of stocks and gold in various interest rate environments from 1972, when the U.S. dollar was taken off the gold standard, to 2013. Here's what they found: __ Sure, the expected returns from stocks in a period of rising interest rates are considerably lower than times when rates are flat or falling, but that doesn't necessarily mean that gold is a more attractive investment than stocks when it happens. The only argument that this could still be the case is that this is only 40 years of data, and it could be too small of a sample size for this investment theory to show up. __ There are reasons to invest in gold versus stocks or other assets, but the theory that investors should go to gold when interest rates are on the rise doesn't seem to hold water.  __ Reuben Gregg Brewer: Most precious-metals miners don't have particularly enticing dividend histories. That's driven by the mining business model, which produce huge profits when gold and silver prices are high, but can lead to big losses when the prices of these often-volatile commodities plunge. The costs of mining simply can't adjust quickly enough to falling prices, leading to weak margins. __ But that's not the case with streaming companies like Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD). Streamers provide cash upfront to miners for the right to buy gold and silver at reduced rates in the future. That locks in wide margins in both good times and bad. As an example, Royal Gold has a deal with mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX) at the Pueblo Viejo Mine that allows it to buy gold and silver at 30% of the spot price until certain production targets are met, and 60% thereafter. Its costs will never go above the spot price. __ That backdrop helps explain how Royal Gold has managed to increase its dividend every single year for 17 consecutive years. The average annual growth rate of the last decade was roughly 15% a year. That's an incredible record for any company, let alone one that operates in the precious-metals industry. __ To be fair, Royal Gold's roughly 1.2% yield probably won't excite you. But if you're an income investor looking to hold some gold to help diversify your portfolio, you can, indeed, find reliable dividends in the precious-metals space. __ Sean O'Reilly: If there's one myth that surrounds investing in gold, it's that only speculators dabble in trading and owning the precious metal. Like all myths, it's grounded in some truth. __ Gold futures are a favorite staple of commodity traders on the futures markets. The world's most famous investor, Warren Buffett, famously eschews gold. But to other successful investors -- many of whom are billionaires in their own right -- gold can and should be owned in the right circumstances. __ Take Ray Dalio, founder of the world's biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Just a few months ago, Dalio went on record saying that markets are ignoring rising political risks. He cited potential conflict between the United States and North Korea as an example. __ What's a man who runs a $160 billion hedge fund to do should bombs start flying? Buy gold. __ If things go badly with North Korea, or if the political situation in the U.S. continues to worsen, Dalio says an investor would want up to 5%-10% of a portfolio in gold. He's putting his money where his mouth is. According to the latest SEC filings, Dalio increased his holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEMKT:GLD) by a whopping 575% in Q3, to $473 million. __ Dalio isn't alone. Hedge-fund veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, who served as the lead portfolio manager at George Soros' Quantum Fund throughout the 1990s, thinks of gold as a currency. __ Of course, investors don't want to hold any currency for long. But if stocks and bonds are unattractive, one should sit on their hands. Druckenmiller is happy to own gold as a ""parking spot."" In an interview with Bloomberg in February 2017, Druckenmiller stated: ""I wanted to own some currency and no country wants its currency to strengthen... gold was down a lot, so I bought it."" __ The world's smartest investors use gold as an insurance policy. In addition, gold producers are often found in their portfolios. Druckenmiller's old boss, Soros, has recently held shares in Barrick Gold. __ While it may not be as profitable as owning dividend-paying stocks in the long run, gold isn't just for speculators. It's also another option that the world's top investors use to their advantage. __  __ Reuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

New tax legislation also plays a part as do rising commodity prices. Fourth-quarter results begin to trickle in this week, with a few major financial stocks reporting Friday. WTI crude oil for February delivery settled at $61.73 a barrel, up 0.5% for the day. February gold dropped about 0.1% on the day to settle at $1,320.40, the yellow metal’s first losing session after 11 straight winners. Equities were headed for a narrowly mixed close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.06% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.17%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.31%. __ Bitcoin futures for January delivery traded at $14,725, down about 11.2% on the CME after opening at $16,245 this morning. Only 931 contracts had been traded in the session and open interest is just 671. __ The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Monday was UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) which traded down 1.57% at $225.13. The stock’s 52-week range is $156.09 to $231.77. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 3 million. The healthcare company had no specific news. __ The Walt Disney Co; (NYSE: DIS) traded down 1.42% at $110.04. The stock’s 52-week range is $96.20 to $116.10.

The stock’s 52-week range is $17.25 to $31.66. Volume was about 25% below the daily average of around 82 million shares. Analysts at J.P. Morgan cut the stock’s price target — and after the stock was the leading yearly gainer among the Dow 30 at the end of the year’s first week of trading. __ Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) traded down 1.17% at $36.43. The stock’s 52-week range is $30.90 to $37.35. Volume was about 20% below the daily average of around 15 million shares.

80,Zachary Riley,http://www.valuewalk.com/2018/01/china-israel-bitcoin-price-drop/,2018-01-08T21:00:53Z,Warnings From China And Israel Cause Bitcoin Price Drop,"VALUE INVESTING __ VALUE INVESTING __ The meteoric rise of bitcoin and the idea of cryptocurrency in general is unprecedented, and a couple of weeks ago the bitcoin price skyrocketed to almost $20000. The recent rise in value has caused many first-time investors to get involved with cryptocurrency, but recent warnings from China and Israel continue the steep bitcoin price drop. __ This recent bitcoin price drop doesn’t spell the end for the cryptocurrency, but it does serve to keep expectations in check regarding the reliability of the currency as a viable investment opportunity. While most traditional investments are tied to real-world metrics like a company’s performance, cryptocurrency price is simply a matter of supply and demand – and this recent bitcoin price drop indicates that the huge spike in interest wasn’t meant to last. __ The fact that the bitcoin price almost reached $20000 per coin garnered the attention of many people around the world – including governmental bodies. After this recent bitcoin price drop, a lot of people lost a lot of money, and governmental agencies are stepping in to voice their displeasure regarding the idea of cryptocurrencies as a whole. __ Bloomberg reported on leaked documents from China that suggest that the country’s finance regulator may crack down on cryptocurrency mining. Additionally, the central Bank in Israel has also voiced concerns earlier today, stating that it won’t make the move to recognize bitcoin as a legitimate currency. __ With nothing to tie the value of cryptocurrency to, the bitcoin price drop after this recent news was sharper than expected. Traditional investors and enterprising individuals alike recognize the volatility of the currency, and many people start to unload their stockpile after a notable bitcoin price drop, exacerbating the issue and causing the decline to accelerate faster than normal. __ The crackdown from China is especially concerning, considering how big of a player the country is in the worldwide economy. Their issue is with the bitcoin mining itself, suggesting that powering computers specifically to dig up new coins is a waste of electricity – proposing restrictions on large mining groups that are located within the country. While the issue with mining itself might not spell the end for the currency in China, the fact remains that a number of large bitcoin farms are located in Asia due to their low electricity costs. Taxing and otherwise increasing the charges of these large organizations may have a notable effect on the continued health of the currency worldwide. A bitcoin price drop is to be expected following trepidation from such an influential government, but the crash is pretty significant considering how high the currency recently climbed. __ This supposed crackdown is just the latest in a number of steps that China has taken to make the country less attractive to bitcoin mining groups. Recent shutdowns of cryptocurrency exchanges significantly impacted the country’s cryptocurrency scene, and the government is currently taking steps towards banning initial coin offerings (ICOs). __ A recent report from Reuters also gives troubling news from Israel, with word that Deputy Governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg stated to Israel’s parliamentary finance committee that bitcoin is not a real currency. This news comes alongside reports from Israeli cryptocurrency bank customers that are having difficulties purchasing bitcoin. Baudot-Trajtenberg explained the difficulties in regulating the currency because of the lack of real-world ties, and expressed that there may be difficulties accessing and trading the currencies until financial regulators issue banking guidelines. If the country is to continue to take steps to make it difficult to trade cryptocurrency within its borders, that’s not exactly an insignificant drop in bitcoin business. __ While having a few countries that don’t allow access to bitcoin may not be a problem in and of itself, it sets a precedent that could lead to a bigger bitcoin price drop if more governments were to refuse to recognize the investment as a legitimate currency. __ The bitcoin price drop today was notable, declining over 8% from its position at $17000 over the weekend. Before too long, the bitcoin price will be close to $15000 which is around a 25% drop from its recent high that had attracted thousands of new investors. __ This recent news is concerning for the fledgling currency, and also has an impact on the trajectory of the myriad of less valuable cryptocurrencies that are struggling to find footing themselves. A bitcoin price drop is always concerning to investors, but the takeaway from this recent drop is the trepidation the currency finds itself in on the world stage. With the huge amount of money involved in the world of cryptocurrencies, it’s no longer to ignore the impact they have on the investment community. If other countries express their concerns, it’s definitely possible that this bitcoin price drop is just the beginning of an even bigger decline. __

No, it’s MicGoat, a new app to debate controversial issues","Debating is at the core of a robust society — as are online social networks. When combined, they transmute each other into a minefield of negativity, abuse and destruction. With products today, we are either living in an echo chamber of like-minded people who agree with us all the time, or we’re duking it out in trench warfare format for little gain and few opinions changed. __ Micgoat is hoping to change that. The product, which officially launched its debate platform app on the App Store today, uses short presidential debate-style videos to elevate the discussion around controversial topics. Users of Micgoat  can propose topics such as “will bitcoin crash” or “we should have universal basic income,” and then make a short, one-minute video about the topic. Users who watch the video can then reply with their own 30-second videos. __ The idea is that it is too easy to troll on traditional social networks, not to mention that bot networks can quickly devolve interesting debates. By emphasizing video in its product, Micgoat’s goal is to persuade people to talk to one another in a more human way, reducing the disinhibition effect that comes from posting text online. __ Users can scroll through different debates on the platform __ The app is the brainchild of Justin Zhen and Gregory Ugwi, the co-founders of Thinknum, a New York-based financial data and analysis platform, along with Marta Lopata, who joined the company last year and is now Micgoat’s CEO. Thinknum has previously raised a seed round from Pejman Mar Ventures. __ Having watched the 2016 U.S. presidential election along with debates on technology subjects like bitcoin, the three realized that they shared a common passion around the quickly degrading quality of debates online. “I think what a great debate looks like is when there are two people from completely different backgrounds who are able to come together and talk about controversial issues,” Lopata explained to me. Too often, existing social networks just don’t offer that sort of quality. __ Lopata, whose background is in entrepreneurship and who spent five years in Asia, believes that a product like Micgoat has the opportunity to turn the tide. She emphasized that there are multiple sides to most debates, and that the combination of video and showing two sides is a powerful antidote to the belief that each of our own views is automatically correct. __ While politics is what most people think of when they hear debates, technology and finance are industries where passions can be even more intense. Those industries also are very familiar to Thinknum, whose clients are financial analysts. __ Zhen said, “Since we have the technology in place, people can debate sports, or local politics. Right now, there is no efficient channel for local politicians to get up in front of their constituents, since Fox News and CNBC don’t cover those races. We can be just part of the everyday dialogue.” __ Thinknum staff are helping with the product development and engineering of the product today. Lopata says that “Right now we see a balance of working together, and long-term we can see us spinning out.” There are three full-time employees on Micgoat, and another seven members borrowed from the core Thinknum team. __ Long-term, the team hopes to add more “gamification” features to encourage everyone in the community to engage with the debates. In addition, the team is optimizing its search algorithms so users will be able to better find the most interesting debates. Zhen suggested that audio transcription would allow for better searching while maintaining the video experience of the app. The company also intends to release an Android version shortly. __ So far, abuse has not been a problem, according to the company. Zhen believes that the combination of Facebook identity and showing one’s face in the app helps reduce the abuse that can be endemic on other platforms. As the platform scales up, the team intends to be very careful to ensure that the community stays positive even when discussing tough challenges."

Even fewer understand it. __   __  __ That’s going to change in 2018. __ Author Malcolm Gladwell defines “the tipping point” as “the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling point” in which “ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread like viruses.” __ Crypto assets reached this tipping point in 2017. __ Bellwether crypto bitcoin surged nearly 1,500%, and total market cap of the crypto space surged from $18 billion at the start of the year to over $600 billion. __ But while bitcoin put in a stellar year, that doesn’t mean Main Street investors have missed the boat yet. 2018 makes the perfect time to jump into cryptocurrencies… __ In just nine years, crypto assets have ballooned from a tiny project among libertarian-minded cryptography experts to a global phenomenon. __ Corporations and governments are hiring blockchain experts to figure out how to integrate this new technology into their existing businesses. __ Expectations for the future of this new asset class range from the Holy Grail that replaces all middlemen on transactions (including banks and governments) to the world’s greatest Ponzi scheme orchestrated by state-sponsored actors in North Korea. __ However, I believe investing in bitcoin in 2018 is actually a safer bet than it was two years ago. While the same astronomical returns might not repeat, the risk of total loss has been dramatically reduced. __ One of the keys to opening up growth in this sector is simplifying access to new investors. Apps such as Coinbase make buying and selling bitcoin much easier than before. __ Coinbase replaced YouTube as the most downloaded app on iTunes. With a few swipes and taps, investors can now swap their dollars for bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. You can buy bitcoin from the comfort of your couch or while watching your 8-year-old’s soccer game. The market is open 24/7/365. __ Globally, there are roughly 30 million bitcoin wallets open. However, many crypto investors own more than a few, so the number of people who actually own bitcoin is likely closer to 10 million. __ While there has been rampant growth in wallets in recent months, investors haven’t emptied out their savings and brokerage accounts into the crypto universe. Out of those 30 million wallets, only 3 million contain more than $1,000 in bitcoin, and only 1 million contain more than $10,000 in bitcoin. __ Keep in mind the total crypto market cap at $800 billion is just 0.3% of the $215 trillion in total assets globally. There is still ample room for this market to grow as more investors open accounts. __ No speculative mania has ever been easier for everyone in the world to participate in than the crypto markets, yet this would qualify as the most underowned, concentrated bubble in history. __ Main Street investors have been watching from the sidelines for too many great opportunities while Wall Street and the investing elite have prospered. __ Take the case of Facebook. __ While shares of Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB) have risen 355% since its 2012 initial public offering (IPO), early-stage investors were sitting on gains of up to 60,000% before reaching public hands. __ Uber now commands a $48 billion private market valuation. This is 12,000 times higher than its original valuation of $4 million. __ But not one cent of this increase in value has reached the public. Rather, all the gains have accrued to Silicon Valley insiders and large institutions. __ This is not the same with crypto, where everyone has an equal shot of finding the next Uber, Amazon or Google. __ Wall Street is just now starting to get involved. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) launched bitcoin futures in December, which helps the markets function. Goldman Sachs is launching an institutional crypto trading desk. __ This all signals that cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and there is still plenty of money waiting on the sidelines for those who jump in now. __ In the last few months, bitcoin and the rest of the crypto world went mainstream. The barriers to entry are gone, and savvy investors now see the potential of this new investment class. __ And since institutional money is still en route, this market — and the gains — will only increase. __ That’s why I say this marks the end of the beginning. The question is no longer whether bitcoin will be essential to a diversified portfolio. It is now a matter of what percentage you want to own, and what other crypto assets are your best bets. __   __ It's underowned because most people aren't dumb enough to buy into it. __ In other news: The Flat Earth Society claims to have members in countries all around the globe.  LOL __   __ In reply to It's underowned because most… by The_Juggernaut __ Funny!!!  Spit coffee on keyboard reading that ... __ In reply to In other news: The Flat… by IH8OBAMA __ On the flip side, the more people mining and circulating, the greater the need to get out. __ In reply to Funny!!!  Spit coffee on… by ReturnOfDaMac __ I'm shocked that Vegas hasn't gotten into cryptocurrencies.

Stupid are the people who call people who are increasing their value stupid, but they themselves seeing little or no gain. So the rich crypto people are stupid while your ass still lives in a trailer. __ FYI, gold has little benefit either. Sure, it is a great conductor, but that's about it. Sure, it doesn't corrode, so you can shower with it, whoopie. Oh, and it makes a great deepwater fishing weight because it is both heavy and malleable. Oh yea, and it is pretty. That sums up gold. __ While we are told that it is a rare resource, there is still plenty to mine. Sure, all the gold ever mined can fit in a 4 bedroom house, but I wonder how many houses it would take to house all of the certificates lying to people telling them they own gold? And, will the central banks ever stop cheating gold? The answer is no. __ Now, if all of you naysayers were given the choice to either have a BC given to you or a piece of paper given to you by a bank saying that you own a BC, which would you take? If u dislike BC, u take it and cash it out. Or you hold it.

Gold per weight can still buy what it could buy 100 years ago. Money stores value. Bitcoin is a unit of account- A digital number. A great technology that will be here a long time. But this is a bubble no matter what item it is. It trades like a bubble. If it was real estate it would be a bubble.

Composition: Jordan Pearson __  For almost two years, hackers could have easily stolen your prized stash of bitcoins if you were keeping them in the popular software wallet Electrum, thanks to a critical security vulnerability that went unpatched until now.  __  The vulnerability allowed any website (and anyone controlling the site a victim browsed, like a hacker) to steal bitcoins stored using Electrum, as long as the software was running and there was no encryption password set up, according to security researchers. The bug was initially reported by Github user “jsmad” on November 24, 2017. Electrum, however, didn’t fully patch the bug until Sunday, January 7, and only after Google security researcher alerted them to how serious the bug really was. __  “The bitcoin wallet Electrum allows any website to steal your Bitcoins,” Ormandy tweeted on Saturday. “I was gonna report it… but there was already an open issue from last year. I pointed out this is kinda critical, and they made a new release within a few hours.” __  Read more:  The Motherboard Guide To Not Getting Hacked __  Mustafa Al-Bassam, a postgraduate researcher at University College London, told me over Twitter that the hackers could have exploited the bug since February 2016, almost two years ago, when developers released Electrum 2.6.  __  “[The bug] allows any malicious website to control your Electrum wallet, including stealing all your Bitcoin if the wallet isn't encrypted with a password,” Al-Bassam told me via Twitter direct message. Even if the wallet does have a password, he explained, a hacker could still redirect bitcoins from the wallet to their address.  __  An initial patch for the bug was released on Saturday, but confusion ensued as the patch didn’t actually fix the whole issue, according to Electrum itself. The company said on Twitter that its initial patch (3.0.4) “did not completely address the vulnerability.” The final patch only came later, on Sunday.  __  Electrum’s founder, Thomas Voegtlin, explained over email that the company didn’t realize how critical the bug was back in November, because even the researcher who made the initial report didn’t know. “That is why we did not consider the initial bug report as critically urgent,” Voegtlin told me in an email. __  In January, once Google researcher Ormandy explained the bug’s serious effects to Electrum, the developers rushed to patch it, releasing a partial fix as soon as possible and then a complete fix a day later. According to Voegtlin, this staggered rollout was the plan all along.  __ Read More: Ethereum Wallet Company Knew About Critical Flaw That Let a User Lock Up Millions __  “When a zero day exploit is made public, it is important to address the vulnerability as soon as possible, because attackers are going to use the exploit,” Voegtlin wrote me in an email. “This is why we released 3.0.4 immediately, before password protection was ready.” __  For some, however, Electrum’s slow turnaround in patching the vulnerability is bound to bring up bad memories. Last year, millions of dollars worth of Ethereum’s cryptocurrency was locked up forever, allegedly by accident, thanks to a bug that was known to the wallet developers but left unaddressed for months. __  The Electrum bug is now fully patched, but there’s a chance hackers could still take advantage of it, if users haven’t updated their software. Electrum doesn’t automatically update, so many victims might be vulnerable unless they proactively check and apply the patch, according to Al-Bassam.  __  “I think this bug will be exploited for a while, since Electrum doesn't have a built-in upgrade mechanism on Windows and Linux,” he added. Twitter user “h43z” showed how the bug can be easily exploited in a short proof-of-concept video showing a bare-bones site they developed to attack their own wallet. __  The vulnerability was in Electrum’s JSON-RPC interface, which wasn’t properly secured. JSON-RPC is a simple protocol that allows data and other code to be exchanged between clients and servers, which is also used by several other digital wallets or software, such as wallets for Ethereum, a competing cryptocurrency.  __  It’s unclear if Electrum’s JSON-RPC vulnerability, specifically, was ever actually exploited by hackers. But in recent months, security researcher Dimitrios Slamaris and others noticed that criminal hackers have tried to find vulnerable Ethereum wallets by scanning the internet for JSON-RPC interfaces exposed on the internet. This interface, as Bleeping Computer reported, should in theory be only exposed locally, but if it is exposed to the wider internet then it can be used to steal cryptocurrency. __  Given how much hackers love to steal Bitcoins and any other cryptocurrencies, if you use Electrum, you should probably patch your wallet app immediately.  __    Got a tip?

 __ Talis Putnins and Jonathan Karlsen, Professors at the University of Technology Business School in Sydney, together with Dr. Sean Foley from Sydney University, have been jointly working on a research whose results are shocking. In their yet to be published document ”Sex, Drugs, Darknet and Bitcoins,” the nearly half of all bitcoin transactions involve illegal trading either directly or indirectly on the dark web, a section of the internet that cannot be accessed using the a standard search engine. __ Access to the dark web is made possible via the “Tor browser” that allows the users to surf without giving away the identity of the location from where the login has taken place and hence a safe marketplace for criminals. Individual logins and all transactions are masked and not indexed. __ With the help of the dark web and bitcoin anonymity, Bitcoin is being used actively in buying and selling of illegal goods and services. This includes money laundering, cybercrime activity, illegal Drugs and weapons trading, terrorism financing, human trafficking, child pornography, illegal internet and software gambling and theft of the Bitcoins themselves from their anonymous owners’ virtual wallets. __ The researchers used forensic finance techniques and blockchain technology which still has greater promise in almost all industries. They established a unique method of filtering out illegal bitcoin transactions by first analyzing the trade networks of already known illegal activity; using information scraped from the darkweb. The team then went about a study of dark web and bitcoin cases that have been closed, by tracking criminal activities of bitcoins users from a global database since 2009, and who had in the past been arrested by law enforcers and other federal agents in online crimes. __ “Most people believe that bitcoin is highly untraceable and that its anonymity is by far beyond law enforcers but looking from a closer distance and digging a little dipper is astonishing,” says Prof. Putnins. “We were able to come up with characteristics that can be used to clearly differentiate [between a bitcoin used in a] user’s involved illegal activity from those using legally,” he added. __ “The main reason for our research is to aide law enforcers and regulators to at least have an idea of what is expected of them and how to control, monitor and regulate bitcoins used globally and how to do it as it becomes mainstream,” says Putnins. __ This method developed by professionals can be used by law enforcers and authorities to trace online criminals, surveillance activities on the dark web and to analyze other blockchains. It is now possible to analyze the extent at which one tries to hide and conceal their identity and their transaction records. Using these two methods makes it possible to approximate the size of the darknet market facilitated and associated to illegal activities involving Bitcoins. “In the hands of regulators or federal police, our methods potentially provide a lot of value in understanding what is going on and cracking it down,” Putnins concluded. __ Thats some bs right there __ Fake news __ Bitcoin airdrop. Do youo think it was just for fun, LOL of course not it was about research PERIOD __ Every American dollar bill is tainted with cocaine. That is ALL the American Money, not just 47% of it.
Gold, jewelry, cars, planes, boats, etc are the real wealth, and everything of value has been used to launder money or was used in illegal activity.
Bitcoin use for an illegal transaction is just one more asset of trade in a long list of assets used to convey wealth. __ Stop shittin on the bit. It can’t be counterfeited, it is cheaper to produce than coins and fiat paper, it is faster than the current banking system, It offers some measure of privacy in a world controlled by bankers, that want every excuse to take your money.
Shitting on the bit is sacrilege, old farts want to keep their system, young farts are going to implement a better system while the old farts die off and take their piece of history with them .

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. __ After a bumper 2017, the cryptocurrency market is attracting new traders who wish to make a fortune in short time. While this is a bullish development, it is also fraught with risk. Most newbies entering the markets believe that it is a ‘get rich quick’ scheme. __ However, a majority will end up investing in coins that are likely to vanish from the scene in a few years. Too many inexperienced traders willing to buy at any price can lead to a bubble, which will end with a sharp downturn that does not bounce back quickly. __ Hope, we are smart enough to identify the bear market beforehand and emerge with minimum losses. Traders should always keep an eye on the risk so that they can last in this business for the long-term.   __ Bitcoin could not sustain above $17,000 levels, which encouraged profit booking and selling at the higher levels. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the trendline support, hitting our trailing stop loss at $15,000. __ If the bears can sustain below $15,000, the cryptocurrency will become negative and extend its fall to $14,000. Below this level, the 50-day SMA is the last major support, which has not been broken convincingly since end-September. __ Therefore, if the bears succeed in sustaining below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate weakness. __ The head and shoulders pattern is still intact and if the price breaks below the neckline, traders should brace themselves for lower levels, even below $10,000. __ Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair takes support and turns around from any of the above-mentioned support levels and breaks out of $17,200 levels. __ Ethereum broke out of the ascending channel yesterday, Jan. 7, and rose to $1,191 levels, where it witnessed profit booking. We had mentioned $1,200 as one of the possible targets in our previous analysis. If bulls manage to break out of $1,200, the next target on the upside is $1,310, which is arrived at by adding the width of the channel to the breakout point of the channel.   __ However, currently, the price has turned down and has entered into the channel once again, which is a negative sign. Levels that can offer support are $993.91 and $933.03, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent retracement levels of the latest leg of the rally. __ If the bulls fail to propel the ETH/USD pair back above the channel quickly, we most likely see a fall to $820, which is the trendline support of the channel increase. __ Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the $2,800 levels yesterday, Jan. 7. As a result, it has now formed a range between $2,291 and $2,770.6933. __ The lower end of the range has held on four occasions. If it holds again, we are likely to witness a few more days of range-bound trading. __ But if the range breaks down, it is likely to attract further selling, which can sink the BCH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA, close to $2,000.     __ For the past three days, Ripple has been trading inside the large range formed on Jan. 5. The support on the downside is between $2.13492, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, and $2.15777, the low on Jan. 5. __ On the upside, resistance lies at $2.849, $3.06 and $3.317. __ As mentioned earlier, we expect the XRP/USD pair to fall to about $1.4 levels eventually and remain range bound for the next few days. __ It’ll prove to be wrong if the price breaks out to new lifetime highs.      __ On Jan. 7, IOTA again failed to sustain above the overhead resistance at $4.34. We hold long positions initiated at $3.904 and $4.121. __ As the bulls have failed to sustain above $4.34 on three occasions, we believe that the bears are likely to push the cryptocurrency down to the lower end of the range. __ Our current suggested stop loss is at $2.85. Although considering the weakness in Bitcoin and most other top currencies, we recommend raising our stop loss to $3.5. __ We shall initiate long positions again when the IOTA/USD pair falls to the bottom of the range at $3.032.     __ The attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend in Litecoin hit a wall on Jan. 6, at $307.992. __ After the stellar rally from $84.708 to $370, the cryptocurrency has entered a period of correction/consolidation and has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern.   __ A breakout from the triangle and the overhead resistance at $307.992 is likely to resume the uptrend in the cryptocurrency. __ On the other hand, a breakdown from the triangle will be bearish, which can result in a sharp fall if the price breaks below $175.199. __ As long as the LTC/USD pair trades inside the triangle, it is likely to remain volatile and trendless. __ We had recommended a long position at $1.072 expecting a retest of the highs. Yet, NEM could only reach a high of $1.9. __ Like all other cryptocurrencies, the XEM/USD pair has also turned down sharply. It is likely to break below our stop loss of $1.4 and fall towards the trendline. If the trendline support breaks, a fall to $0.795 is likely.    __ On the upside, the bulls will face a stiff resistance between $1.9 and the lifetime highs. __ After the large range day on Jan. 5, Cardano remained in a small range on Jan. 6 and Jan.7. __ Today, the cryptocurrency has turned down. Its immediate support is at 0.00005347, which is the low reached Jan. 5. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to the 20-day EMA. __ However, if the ADA/BTC pair holds the support levels, we may see another attempt to resume the uptrend.

Until recently it would’ve been hard to imagine this could ever happen — this kind of money doesn’t just disappear overnight, and destroying it would take incredibly long. __ But last week it did — though it wasn’t traditional money. With cryptocurrencies, making millions disappear now only takes one person and a couple of clicks. __ On November 7th, a user of Ethereum wallet Parity stumbled upon a bug that allowed him to convert a contract that was governing multisignature wallets into a regular wallet address. This so-called smart contract was critical to make transactions to and from a set of wallets possible. __ After converting the contract the user was able to make himself the owner. Stunned by what happened, he then inadvertently killed the contract, immediately rendering all associated wallets unusable. The user later reported the bug as a ticket on Parity’s GitHub However, without any way to access the Ether inside, millions of dollars were already locked inside hundreds of frozen wallets. __ If you’re not an expert on crypto, all of this might sound a bit complicated. Let’s look at the situation from an easier to understand perspective: __ Let’s say someone convinced a lot of people to put all of their money in a single box because it’s extra secure. Unfortunately no one knew that the box would burn down when it would be moved too much. Then your two-year-old brother finds the box, it quickly catches fire and all the money inside is gone within seconds. __ According to Parity, however, there’s a small sidetone to the story — it says the money isn’t technically gone, it’s just frozen inside locked wallets. But if that’s the case, it seems like nobody is currently able to unfreeze the funds. __ On November 8, the company released the results of a comprehensive audit revealing that the 578 frozen wallets held a total of 513,774.16 Ether, which amounts to roughly $170 million at the time of writing. In total, 573 people were affected by the incident — that’s a lot of people losing a lot of money. __ There’s no quick and easy fix for this problem — because of the way the Blockchain works, the possibilities are very limited. __ The most straightforward option would be to implement a hard fork. This effectively creates a new version of the Blockchain in which the incident never took place, immediately making all funds accessible again. Hard forks have previously been successful in returning lost funds, for example after a large-scale hack of decentralized venture capital fund the DAO in June 2016. To execute a hard fork, at least 51% of users on the network need to implement it, but it only took a month to convince enough people. __ The problem is that pushing a hard fork today won’t be as easy — the Ethereum community has grown a lot since then, which means it’s much harder to get a majority to jump on the fork. __ Another, arguably easier option would be to focus on an early proposal by Etherereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. EIP156 describes a way for users to reclaim Ether stuck in frozen accounts. The proposal is still under review, however, making it unclear if it’ll ever end up being implemented by the core Ethereum developers. __ It’s not the first time Parity is in hot water — a couple of months ago it became the target of a hacker who made off with $32 million dollars using an earlier vulnerability in the multisignature wallets. The fix for this introduced a new bug that eventually led to the freezing incident. __ Cryptocurrencies have a lot of things going for them — they’re a great way to quickly send money to anyone in the world without having to depend on a bank. It’s even possible to do this without revealing your identity by using the right anonymization tools, which makes it easy to protect your privacy. __ Unfortunately, this also creates fertile ground for hackers, who can silently siphon away funds to unidentifiable accounts. There’s a long list of high-profile cryptocurrency hacks, topped by the March 2014 breach of then-dominant exchange Mt. Gox. Over the course of several years, the attackers were able to make $473 million in Bitcoin disappear without leaving a trace. __ While as of yet it’s still unclear if the wallet freeze was an accident or a deliberate move, it definitely reconfirms the vulnerability of cryptocurrencies. When crypto developers mess up by introducing a critical bug, it can eventually affect accounts holding real money. __ To understand how all of this was able to happen, it’s important to explain the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum. While Bitcoin is not much more than a way to exchange virtual currency, Ethereum also uses the underlying technology for something else. By making it possible for developers to build applications that run on the Blockchain, it’s more than just a way to pay people — it’s a global computing platform. Because Ethereum has more features than Bitcoin it’s generally seen as less secure, as it has more possible exploit sources. __ Parity is a client built on top of Ethereum, which uses its own open-source codebase — the code that contained the bug that led to the frozen wallets. The company’s website prides itself with having a 100% reviewal rate by at least one expert developer. In this case that wasn’t enough. __ The vulnerable part of the code had been deployed months ago, and somehow managed to escape code review by both the open source community and the Parity team. Thanks to simple human error, hundreds of millions of dollars are now stuck. All of this could’ve been avoided by doing proper code review, which would’ve caught the bug before inflicting irreversible damage. __ Parity says it regularly employs external auditors to do formal audits of their smart contracts, but states that the solution to these kinds of problems isn’t doing more audits. Instead, it would make more sense to implement more formal procedures and tooling around the deployment, monitoring and testing of contracts. There’s some serious truth to this — using tools like automated code review can significantly decrease the chances of a development mishap. __ By automatically identifying security issues and ensuring compliance, automatic code review makes it easier to write great-working code. By using these tools, developers can save up to 30–50% of their time that they would normally spend reviewing, while seeing their code quality steadily increase. Having an extra pair of eyes to look for errors can help a lot when trying to write great software. __ People make mistakes, so it’s a good idea to double down on code review — especially when there’s lots of money involved. You’ll enjoy the peace of mind that comes from having a thoroughly reviewed codebase. __ By clapping more or less, you can signal to us which stories really stand out. __ words about tech & digital culture __ how hackers start their afternoons."

Here's a rundown of the price action in the cryptocurrency markets today and over the weekend, and what could be causing these moves. __ Here's a look at the 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past 24 hours, as well as the change since before the weekend. __ Cryptocurrency __ Price in U.S. Dollars __ 1-Day Change __ Change Since 1/5/18 __ Bitcoin (BTC) __ $15,020 __ (7.1%) __ (8.4%) __ Ethereum (ETH) __ $1,147.30 __ 5.1% __ 17.5% __ Ripple (XRP) __ $2.47 __ (10.5%) __ (6.8%) __ Bitcoin Cash (BCH) __ $2,390.30 __ (6.9%) __ 0.8% __ Cardano (ADA) __ $0.91 __ (11.5%) __ (15%) __ NEM (XEM) __ $1.58 __ (7.6%) __ (4.2%) __ Litecoin (LTC) __ $257.32 __ (5.2%) __ 4.4% __ Stellar (XLM) __ $0.64 __ (9.3%) __ (4.5%) __ IOTA (MIOTA) __ $3.87 __ (7.5%) __ 0.5% __ TRON (TRX) __ $0.146 __ (3.7%) __ (33.6%) __ Data source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of 2:40 p.m. EST, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate. __ As you can see, cryptocurrency prices are down nearly across the board. The sole digital currency in the top 10 up for the day is Ethereum, which we'll get to in a bit. __ Image source: Getty Images. __ Bitcoin dropped more than 7% after surging late last week. According to Coindesk, fears that China may get tough on bitcoin miners could be weighing on the currency. After all, China accounts for over two-thirds of all bitcoin mining activity, and a crackdown on Chinese mining operations could produce negative pressure on bitcoin. According to people familiar with the matter, China intends to limit power use by miners. (Note: If you're not familiar with bitcoin mining, let's just say that it uses a lot of energy.)  __ Ethereum is moving against the grain, and hit a record high on Monday above $1,200. It has since retreated a bit, but is still up 17.5% over the weekend, and has reclaimed its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency, behind only bitcoin. __ According to a report, transaction volume on Ethereum's network doubled and there have been periods where over 10 transactions per second were being processed. For comparison, bitcoin's blockchain network can only handle about three transactions per second.  __ The highlight of the cryptocurrency market last week was the big move in several alternative currencies, or altcoins. Ripple, Cardano, Stellar, NEM, and Tron all posted massive gains for the week, and all of them seem to be giving back some of those gains. __ Tron in particular has been beaten up over the weekend, giving up roughly one-third of its value. However, even after the loss, Tron is still up by more than 215% over the past seven days. Cardano is another example, and has lost 15% since Friday. __ Ripple and Stellar, both of which have partnerships with major financial institutions, are holding up better, but are still down, losing 6.8% and 4.5%, respectively, over the weekend. __ To be clear, all five of these altcoins are still in the green over the past week, so the recent drop could simply be profit-taking after their impressive runs. __  __ The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. __ Matt brought his love of teaching and investing to the Fool in 2012 in order to help people invest better.

Maybe even stupider than bitcoin! __ You’ve probably seen charts of European high-yield bonds floating around — yields in the low 2s for BB credits. There was also a European corporate issuer that managed to issue BBB bonds at negative yields a few weeks ago. __ I think that might have been the top. __ Although there is nothing stupid about it — the ECB has been buying every bond in sight, and there’s lots of money to be made front-running central banks. __  How will the ECB exit?  __ Still, it’s possible that we’ve reached the logical limit of emergency monetary policy, and the European Central Bank is going to have to exit sometime in the near future. __ The question is: How are they going to exit without blowing up the bond market? __ And it’s not just the European bond market. The effects have been transmitted to other bond markets as well, like our own. If the ECB exits, or, heaven forbid, the Bank of Japan tries to exit at the same time — and screws it up — there is a potential for a real meltdown. __ What would a meltdown look like? __ Fact: Any time 10-year yields have backed up 200 basis points, there has been a crisis. You have to go back to 1994 for the last one. And we even had a mini-crisis in 2013, which we called the taper tantrum. __ If tens backed up from 2.3% to 4.3%, it would be a crisis of gargantuan proportions. __ What is the probability that it will happen? __  Today’s yields are not worth the risk  __ It’s tough to think of these things in terms of probabilities. For example, it’s very probable that the ECB will begin its exit next year. But what is the probability that they screw it up? __ It’s literally impossible to handicap. You can’t quantify it. But again: crowded theater, small exit. So you know the unwind has the potential to be disorderly if the ECB is careless about how they exit. __ Anyone who has seen markets in action (at least, for a decade or more) knows that selling can lead to more selling, which can lead to more selling, otherwise known as a cascading effect. Nobody under 30 knows what this looks like. __ I actually had a funny conversation with some high-yield guys a few weeks ago. They were laughing at one of their junior traders, who was getting a bit panicked as he watched the index sell off … by 1 point. “This is getting out of control,” he said. __ I am not much interested in the bond market until you get tens to 4, investment grade to 7, and high yield to 12. I will turn into High Yield Harry if you get yields out to 12%. __ Those sound like impossible levels, but you just have to dream a little bigger, dear readers. __ Remember: Cash is an option to buy something cheaper in the future. If yields do get out to 12%, and you don’t have the cash to take advantage of it, you are going to be kicking your own butt all the way down the street. __  How to play when things go sour  __ It is waaaaay too early to be thinking about this, but … __ If you were to try and pick a bottom in the throes of a bear market, it is a lot smarter to do it in the high-yield market than the stock market. __ It’s hard to get hurt too badly when you’re getting paid 12%-14% to wait for a bottom. __ Stocks are a different story. Stocks can go down forever. In 2009, it really seemed like they were going down forever. That is too scary for me. __ But I really like buying credit in bear markets, and I also like buying converts. Go back and look at high-yield and convert mutual funds coming out of bear markets. __ You’re talking about 30%-40% returns, especially on the lower-quality stuff. On a risk-adjusted basis, it’s a lot better than stocks. __ In the meantime, there is nothing to do. __  Jared Dillian is a former Lehman Brothers head of ETF trading.

92,David Floyd,https://www.investopedia.com/news/how-new-tax-law-impacts-cryptocurrencies-trump/,2018-01-08T20:25:00Z,How the New Tax Law Impacts Cryptocurrencies,"Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs __ The tax bill that Donald Trump signed into law in late December represents the most substantive changes to the federal tax code in 30 years, but Congress passed up its chance to clarify matters for cryptocurrency investors, traders, issuers and miners. The community is left with a host of questions and ambiguities; but while the tax bill does not directly address cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether and the tokens issued through ICOs, it does impact them indirectly.  __ Especially important are changes to six provisions in the tax code: like-kind exchanges, loss carrybacks, the corporate tax rate, the business interest deduction, miscellaneous personal deductions, and the treatment of pass-through businesses. (See also, Trump's Tax Reform.) __ Google ""bitcoin tax bill"" or some variation, and most of the results will focus on section 1031 of the tax code, which allows capital gains taxes to be deferred for certain ""like-kind"" exchanges of property for other, similar property. The provision was originally envisioned as a break for farmers swapping livestock, but came to be used for trades in commercial real estate, art and airplanes – and cryptocurrencies.  __ According to three attorneys contacted by Investopedia, at least some cryptocurrency investors regard a sale of bitcoin for ether, for example, to be a like-kind exchange that is exempt from capital gains taxes. None of the attorneys we spoke to, however, is convinced: taxpayers who treat crypto-for-crypto exchanges as like-kind are ""taking the risk that if they got audited, the IRS would disagree,"" says Jeremy Naylor, a partner at Cooley LLP. Under the new law, he continues, ""it's clear now that you can't do that."" The exemption that section 1031 previously applied to ""property of like kind"" only applies to ""real property of like kind"" under the new law, meaning that cryptocurrencies definitely don't qualify. __ Investors considering taking advantage of this break for the 2017 tax year should weigh the risks. Matthew Gertler, senior analyst and counsel at Digital Asset Research, says, ""Like-kind exchanges were never a thing for crypto,"" adding, ""most of the articles I have read supporting that like-kind exchanges apply were not written by attorneys or accountants."" Trading one stock for another doesn't qualify for the break, he points out, nor does trading gold for silver, ""so I want to hear why the trading of one cryptocurrency for the other constitutes the same kind of property."" __ A second change to the tax code affects businesses in the cryptocurrency space, such as those raising money by issuing tokens through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or a similar fundraising method known as a SAFT. Under the old tax law, business losses could be carried back two years, a boon to companies that raise money in a token sale one year, then experience operating losses in subsequent years. The new law eliminates loss carrybacks. __ ""Some folks doing ICOs and raising money selling tokens were assuming they'd be able to use losses [in 2018 and 2019] to offset income in 2017,"" Naylor says. ""That benefit is no longer there."" __ The central provision of the new tax law is a steep cut in the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, at marginal rates ranging from 10% to 37% under the new law in 2018. Long-term capital gains – profits from selling assets held for at least a year – are taxed at a top rate of 20%. For traders who hold cryptocurrencies for shorter durations, therefore, the new corporate rate could represent an opportunity. __ ""We would never suggest that someone take their personal activities and blindly incorporate,"" says Evan Fox, a manager in the tax department at Berdon LLP, but ""there are a few scenarios – and this would need to be analyzed by tax advisors and accountants – where it could make sense for an individual to form a corporation to do their crypto trading."" (See also, How the GOP Tax Bill Affects You.) __ The introduction of a new deduction for pass-through entities, which allow business income to be paid through personal tax returns, could also represent an opportunity. Gertler, Naylor and Fox all stressed that cryptocurrency traders are not eligible for this deduction, but Fox thinks that the pass-through deduction could be interesting to miners. (See also, What Is Bitcoin Mining?) __ The new law allows a deduction of up to 20% of pass-through income, limited to 50% of wages paid by the entity or 25% of wages plus 2.5% of the unadjusted basis of the entity's property. Mining is an extremely capital-intensive business, requiring the purchase of large arrays of ASICs – the specialized hardware used to carry out the hash functions involved in proof of work – and for particularly large organizations, employees to maintain them. __ Another bonus for miners, Fox adds, is immediate expensing for new equipment for five years. __ The new law doesn't just give, however, it taketh away. Business interest deductibility – previously unlimited – will be capped at 30% of adjusted earnings (Ebitda for four years, then Ebit). ""It seems like a lot of clients are tripping"" that limit, says Fox, ""and having a non-deductibility of interest."" Miners in particular appear to be taking on the kind of leverage that runs into the limit. The new cap does not apply to personal interest, he notes, so it won't apply to ""people out there mortgaging their houses to buy bitcoin."" That's ""probably a bad idea,"" he adds. (Yes, it probably is.) __ Finally, individuals should be aware that a number of 2% deductions – which taxpayers who itemize can claim on the amounts by which certain expenditures exceed 2% of adjusted gross income – were eliminated by the new law. ""Especially in the crypto world, people are traveling a lot to see different companies, they're going to conferences, they're buying segregated computers, they're purchasing cold wallets,"" says Fox. ""Expenses can get into the thousands and thousands of dollars, and now those are essentially irrelevant for tax purposes."" __ Naylor cautions that ""a lot of this is going to be unclear until we get regulations that implement the law,"" a caveat that Fox echoed. Investors, traders, miners and the rest of the crypto community should be cautious until the IRS has fleshed out the legislation (due to funding and staffing shortages at the agency, however, this could take several months). And of course taxpayers should seek professional advice before making decisions based on changes to tax law. (See also, The Investopedia Tax Center.) __ Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (""ICOs"") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or other ICOs.

Such blockchain, much cryptocurrency. __ Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that was created in 2013 as a parody of blockchain technology, saw its market cap surpass $2 billion over the weekend — all without anyone doing anything to improve the original tech in about two years. __ Though it began existence as a tribute to the popular “doge” meme and mockery of the then relatively struggling bitcoin, dogecoin has now been swept up in the “alt coin” wave that began in the wake of bitcoin’s own recent surge in value. __ The latest price data currently shows that dogecoin, which hasn’t released a software update in two years, has a current market value of about $1.98 billion and is being traded at $0.017535 per coin. For those keeping track, that means about 114 billion dogecoins have been mined, which is a truly remarkable tribute to misplaced human ingenuity __ All this means dogecoin saw a whopping 69 percent increase compared with just last Friday, with the coin peaking above the $2 billion mark in total market capitalization. __ Despite its rapid rise, the parody coin’s founder says these numbers are worrying. Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer, who left the company in 2015, told CoinDesk: “The fact that most conversations happening in the media and between peers focus on the investment potential is worrying, as it draws attention away from the underlying technology and goals this movement was based [on].” __ Even current developers working on dogecoin, like Patrick Lodder, are equal parts shocked and excited by its rise, considering nobody had to actually do anything for it to surge. __ “To me, this proves that we don’t need shiny features or a ton of innovation and even with a conservative – and in my own case completely distracted – development team for a boom,” Lodder told CoinDesk. __ Palmer and his team created the cryptocurrency all the way back in 2013, naming it after the meme depicting a Japanese shiba inu dog. Before it became the hottest (and most fun) cryptocurrency, dogecoin was branded as “the internet currency” for easy peer-to-peer payments. __ If you’re still trying to get in on some dogecoins, there are several ways to purchase some. Either by mining coins online, or by buying tokens at one of many exchanges. There is even a Reddit tutorial out there aimed to help folks buy dogecoin. __ It’s unclear how the meme-friendly cryptocurrency will fare in the blockchain technology craze. One thing is for sure: dogecoin is definitely the cutest of the 43 cryptocurrencies that currently have a market cap above $1 billion. __ Photos via Flickr / Aranami __ Photos via Flickr / Aranami __ Written by Gabriela Barkho __ More articles by Gabriela • Follow Gabriela on Twitter __ tweet share"

 __  __ By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed __ NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a more than one-week high against a basket of other major currencies on Monday, helped by a pullback in the euro as investors took profits after the common currency's recent rally. __ The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six rival currencies, was up 0.46 percent at 92.368. __ The euro slipped 0.57 percent to $1.196. It had hit a nearly four-month high of $1.2089 on Thursday. __ ""The euro got a little bit over its skies when it traded over $1.20,"" said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. __ ""It's a little bit of profit-taking and some healthy correction going on the euro's side, which is driving some of the dollar trades,"" he said. __ The euro, which has rallied in recent weeks on expectations for a shift in European Central Bank monetary policy this year, was on a weaker footing after a cooler-than-expected reading of the euro zone's December consumer price index on Friday. __ Lackluster inflation pressure in Europe has been accompanied by a strengthening economic recovery across the continent and solid economic growth in China and the United States, fueling risk appetite. __ The dollar found some support after generally solid U.S. economic data last week. __ ""The dollar selling that has been going on since Christmas got a little bit overdone, and we are sort of taking some of that back,"" Bechtel said. __ The dollar has too many tailwinds for a meaningful correction, Bechtel said, citing a tightening Federal Reserve, tax-driven dollar repatriation flows and strength in the U.S. economy. __ Sterling climbed against the broadly weaker euro, after a Cabinet reshuffle alleviated some of the political uncertainty that has pressured the UK currency in recent months. __ The Canadian dollar was slightly weaker against its U.S. counterpart. Canadian companies remain optimistic about future sales despite some moderation from highs, and signs of capacity pressures and labor shortages have picked up, the Bank of Canada said on Monday. __ Bitcoin sank after website CoinMarketCap, which shows real-time prices and market capitalizations for more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies, removed prices from South Korean exchanges from its calculations of digital currency rates. __ Bitcoin was also undermined by news earlier in the session that South Korean financial authorities were inspecting six local banks that offer virtual currency accounts to institutions. __ Bitcoin was down 6.35 percent at $15,100.04 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange after dropping as low as $13,900.

No, it’s MicGoat, a new app to debate controversial issues","Debating is at the core of a robust society — as are online social networks. When combined, they transmute each other into a minefield of negativity, abuse and destruction. With products today, we are either living in an echo chamber of like-minded people who agree with us all the time, or we’re duking it out in trench warfare format for little gain and few opinions changed. __ Micgoat is hoping to change that. The product, which officially launched its debate platform app on the App Store today, uses short presidential debate-style videos to elevate the discussion around controversial topics. Users of Micgoat  can propose topics such as “will bitcoin crash” or “we should have universal basic income,” and then make a short, one-minute video about the topic. Users who watch the video can then reply with their own 30-second videos. __ The idea is that it is too easy to troll on traditional social networks, not to mention that bot networks can quickly devolve interesting debates. By emphasizing video in its product, Micgoat’s goal is to persuade people to talk to one another in a more human way, reducing the disinhibition effect that comes from posting text online. __ Users can scroll through different debates on the platform __ The app is the brainchild of Justin Zhen and Gregory Ugwi, the co-founders of Thinknum, a New York-based financial data and analysis platform, along with Marta Lopata, who joined the company last year and is now Micgoat’s CEO. Thinknum has previously raised a seed round from Pejman Mar Ventures. __ Having watched the 2016 U.S. presidential election along with debates on technology subjects like bitcoin, the three realized that they shared a common passion around the quickly degrading quality of debates online. “I think what a great debate looks like is when there are two people from completely different backgrounds who are able to come together and talk about controversial issues,” Lopata explained to me. Too often, existing social networks just don’t offer that sort of quality. __ Lopata, whose background is in entrepreneurship and who spent five years in Asia, believes that a product like Micgoat has the opportunity to turn the tide. She emphasized that there are multiple sides to most debates, and that the combination of video and showing two sides is a powerful antidote to the belief that each of our own views is automatically correct. __ While politics is what most people think of when they hear debates, technology and finance are industries where passions can be even more intense. Those industries also are very familiar to Thinknum, whose clients are financial analysts. __ Zhen said, “Since we have the technology in place, people can debate sports, or local politics. Right now, there is no efficient channel for local politicians to get up in front of their constituents, since Fox News and CNBC don’t cover those races. We can be just part of the everyday dialogue.” __ Thinknum staff are helping with the product development and engineering of the product today. Lopata says that “Right now we see a balance of working together, and long-term we can see us spinning out.” There are three full-time employees on Micgoat, and another seven members borrowed from the core Thinknum team. __ Long-term, the team hopes to add more “gamification” features to encourage everyone in the community to engage with the debates. In addition, the team is optimizing its search algorithms so users will be able to better find the most interesting debates. Zhen suggested that audio transcription would allow for better searching while maintaining the video experience of the app. The company also intends to release an Android version shortly. __ So far, abuse has not been a problem, according to the company. Zhen believes that the combination of Facebook identity and showing one’s face in the app helps reduce the abuse that can be endemic on other platforms. As the platform scales up, the team intends to be very careful to ensure that the community stays positive even when discussing tough challenges."

Prices continued to drop in what could have been fear-induced sell offs, before the crypto universe's market cap bottomed out at $668.7 billion. __ Ripple has warned its customers to look at multiple data sources before making trading decisions after its XRP cryptocurrency fell from second- to third-largest by market cap because of the change. __ ""Coinmarketcap's decision to exclude Korean prices from the displayed XRP price made the price appear to drop, likely triggering some panic selling,” Ripple’s chief cryptographer David Schwartz said on Twitter. “Look closely at the data and don't be mislead."" __ Korean prices have been outliers ""due to a shortage of cryptos in Korea and difficulty getting KRW out,” Schwartz continued. ""The new price is more accurate and meaningful."" __ At one point overnight, XRP was trading at an average of $3.93 on South Korean exchanges — 38% above the token’s current price of $2.43, according to Markets Insider.
