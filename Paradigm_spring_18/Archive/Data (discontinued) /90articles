Working through Europol, Polish police alerted their Belgium counterparts, who searched his house and seized computer equipment. __ Authorities were able to recover data from the suspect's laptop and remote servers, including encryption keys. Polish police are now encouraging victims of the Polski, Vortex, and Flotera ransomware families to file official complaints with local authorities so they can receive a decryption key for their files. __ The suspect was taken into custody, charged with 181 different crimes, and a judge approved a period of temporary detention of three months. The District Prosecutor's Office in Warsaw said the suspect pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigators. __ An assortment of people have been tracking this prodigious cybercriminal. According to prosecutors, the suspect has been active since 2013, when he first started targeting users via a banking trojan that would replace bank account numbers in users' clipboards with one of his own, so to receive undeserved bank transfers. __ Since the start of 2017, police say Tomasz shifted operations to ransomware. He first created the Polski ransomware in late January, moved on to the Vortex strain in March, and then to the Flotera strain later in the same month. __ Of the three, the Vortex strain remained active through 2017 and 2018. The vast majority of victims were located in Poland, according to data Bleeping Computer received from the ID-Ransomware service. __ Online, Tomasz operated under the nickname ""Armaged0n,"" which he used on the infamous HackForums cybercrime portal. __ Polish tech news site Zaufana Trzecia Strona (ZTS) was the first to draw the lines between the three ransomware strains to the Armaged0n persona and later tracked down a large email spear-phishing operation. __ To distribute his ransomware, and even other malware strains, Tomasz often sent emails to victims posing as a representative from well-known companies active in Poland, such as DHL, Zara, Cinema City, PAY U, WizzAir, but also local Polish companies and state agencies. __ ZTS, CERT Poland, security researchers, police, and the impersonated companies all collaborated to track down the suspect. Police say they suspect Tomasz infected thousands of users with ransomware and made over $145,000 from his criminal endeavors. __ According to prosecutors, law enforcement was able to track down the suspect through ransomware payments. __ Tomasz would gather the ransomware payments in Bitcoin, transfer the funds to a central account, and then exchange the funds in fiat currency at a Polish cryptocurrency exchange via an account associated with his name. Once investigators tracked down his real-world persona, they only had to lie in waiting. __ Even before Polish authorities arrested Tomasz, US security researcher Michael Gillespie had created a decrypter for the Vortex ransomware that he was offering to victims in private. Speaking to Bleeping Computer, Gillespie said he'd reach out to CERT Poland to offer the decrypter so the organization could help victims with a ready-made decryption utility. Gillespie is set to receive an honorary award from the FBI later in April for his work on helping ransomware victims. __ Not a member yet?

Due to the increased demand for energy from large-scale cryptocurrency mining companies, the Commission felt the need to “level the playing field.” __ Said Commission Chair John B. Rhodes: __ We always welcome and encourage companies to build and grow their businesses in New York. However, we must ensure business customers pay an appropriate price for the electricity they use. This is especially true in small communities with finite amounts of low-cost power available. If we hadn’t acted, existing residential and commercial customers in upstate communities served by a municipal power authority would see sharp increases in their utility bills. __  __ The Commission’s ruling came after the New York Municipal Power Agency (NYMPA) — an association comprised of 36 municipal power authorities — requested action be taken against high-density load customers. __ NYMPA cited a negative impact on local power supplies after cryptocurrency mining companies seeking to benefit from the region’s low-cost electricity. According to the Commission’s release, “disproportionately large amounts of power” have been requested in recent months by server farms looking to mine cryptocurrency. __ NYMPA also claimed that cryptocurrency mining companies “do not bring the economic development traditionally associated with similar load-sized companies” — due to the fact that cryptocurrency mining requires a relatively small workforce compared to other electricity-intensive operations. __ NYMPA also claims cryptocurrency mining companies “make little to no capital investment in the local community.” __  __ The change in electricity pricing is expected to drastically increase the costs associated with cryptocurrency mining in upstate New York. __ This news also coincides with Plattsburgh’s outright ban on cryptocurrency mining, after residents’ electricity bills skyrocketed. The Commission’s release notes: __ Had the new rates been in place in January, the two cryptocurrency companies in Plattsburgh would have seen a more than 60 percent increase in their monthly electricity costs. __ What do you think about cryptocurrency mining’s impact on local residents’ and businesses’ energy costs?

 __ A study found that cybercriminals launder $80-$200 billion a year and are moving away from Bitcoin as Monero offers greater anonymity. __ Virtualization technology-focused security firm security firm Bromium announced the findings of an independent study into the macroeconomics of cybercrime. “Into the Web of Profit,” a report released by the company, concludes that cybercriminal proceeds make up an estimated 8-10 percent of total illegal profits laundered globally, which amounts to $80-$200 billion each year. __ Additionally, the report found that virtual currencies are now the primary tool used by cybercriminals for money laundering. Monero, a cryptocurrency that provides greater anonymity, is becoming criminals’ favorite as they move away from Bitcoin. __ Dr. Mike McGuire, Senior Lecturer in Criminology at Surrey University and author of the report, said: __ “It’s no surprise to see cybercriminals using virtual currency for money laundering. The attraction is obvious. It’s digital, so is an easily convertible way of acquiring and transferring cybercrime revenue. Anonymity is also key, with platforms like Monero designed to be truly anonymous, and tumbler services like CoinJoin that can obscure transaction origins. Targeted organizations must do more to protect their customers.” __ The study also found that in-game purchases and currencies are spurring a rise in gaming-related laundering, as China and South Korea become hotspots for gaming-currency laundering; PayPal and other digital payment systems are employed by cybercriminals to launder money; and digital payment systems laundering often involves the use of micro-laundering techniques where multiple, small payments are made so laundering limits aren’t triggered. __ Gregory Webb, Chief Executive Officer of Bromium, commented: “We invested in this research to instigate a meaningful conversation about how to disrupt the economic systems and poor security practices that enable cybercrime around the world; frankly because it’s far too easy for them.” __ “Today it is easy for hackers to infect machines, steal data, and hold businesses and individuals for ransom or sell stolen IP because enterprise defenses are not fit for purpose. It is equally easy for them to wash that money and convert it into cash – and the rise in the use of unregulated, virtual currencies is making this even easier. We need to attack the problem in a different way. Law enforcement, the cybersecurity industry and both the public and private sectors need to be vigilant about disrupting cybercrime. Protecting applications that access sensitive data is an absolute requirement. We need a whole new approach to cybersecurity or these figures will continue to increase over time.” __ While cryptocurrencies have become more popular within the cybercrime industry, it remains unclear whether the impact of digital currencies is large enough to attract the attention of regulators, given that the majority of criminal operations globally are still funded by fiat money, or cash. __ Copyright © 2018 - NewsBTC.

The rate at which supercomputers are taking over the financial sector is leaving no doubt that the future of finance will largely depend on computer scientists and big data experts rather than the traditional financial advisors and traders. __  It is no wonder that the world top financial institutions are now hiring more quantitative analysts and computer scientists than the traditional financial analysts and investment advisors. The CFA Institute, the provider of the world most prestigious professional designation for financial analysts, has realized that it is no longer business as usual in the industry and is now including AI, Big Data, and Machine Learning in its Curriculum. __  On the other hand, Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies, is also having its fair share in the industry with analysts predicting that it will do to the financial system what the internet did to the media. Cryptocurrencies as an investment asset have seen explosive popularity since 2016 with Bitcoin the mother of all cryptocurrencies soaring above 1,500% in 2017 before crumbling 63% in the first month of 2018. __  Other cryptocurrencies (as of now there are over 2000 of them) are seeing the same level of growth and volatility, creating massive investment opportunity on the one hand and big risk on the other. As the amount of data on these digital currencies continues to pile up, crypto-traders are finding it hard to find investment insights manually. __  This has prompted the emergence of AI and Machine Learning driven solutions.

Gox – a once major and now defunct Bitcoin exchange – who reportedly sold over $400 mln in Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) around the new year has stated that he does not believe the sales affected the market prices of BTC or BCH, according to a report released today, March 17. __  __ image courtesy of CoinTelegraph __ Today’s report is a transcript of a Q&A at the 10th Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting, which took place on March 7, 2018, about the selling of BTC and BCH by defunct exchange’s trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. __ The Japan-based Mt.Gox crypto exchange had been the largest in the world until a February 2014 hack led to the loss of around 850,000 BTC. The current sales of BTC and BCH by Kobayashi are part of an attempt to refund users who lost money in the hack. __ An earlier report released March 7 to the Tokyo District Court had said that the BTC/BCH sales took place between the creditors’ meeting in September 2017 and the one on March 7. However the report released today clarifies that the sales took place between December 2017 and January 2018. __ The March 7 report, which detailed the amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash sold by Kobayashi over this reported two month period, led many to believe that the large sell off is what led to the market crash after the new year. __ Kobayashi noted that after consulting with cryptocurrency experts, he “sold BTC and BCC [BCH], not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC [BCH] exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible.” __ Kobayashi added a clarification about the transfers of BTC and BCH to different addresses, underlining that he did not necessarily sell BTC and BCH at the same time as these transfers: __ “Please refrain from analyzing the correlation between the sale of BTC and BCC [BCH] by us and the market prices of BTC and BCC [BCH] based on the assumption that the sale was made at the time the BTC and BCC [BCH] were transferred from BTC/BCC [BCH] addresses that I manage, as such assumption is incorrect.” __  __ It is possible that today’s report was released as a way for Kobayashi to refute accusations of his responsibility in the crash, as many in the crypto community had analyzed the times of the transfers of BTC and BCH in an attempt to correlate them with drops in market price during the same period. However, Cointelegraph did find that a comparison of the transfers and the priceshowed that there was a negative correlation in the short run, daily. __ Kobayashi reported that he sold the two coins at what he believes to be a fair market price, and picked the timing of sale “following consultation with the court.” Kobayashi also noted that he sold BTC and BCH separately, and added that there is no determination yet on future sales of the remaining BTC and BCH. __ A recent Reddit post summarizing Kobayashi’s position from today report’s has garnered conflicting opinions. Reddit user riveriafrank commented on the post that “just because you transact on a dark pool doesnt [sic] mean the price isnt [sic] affected.” Another Reddit user, samonx, the author of the post, added an alternative explanation for the market dip in the past couple months that does not include Kobayashi: __ “Large holders sold at a high price driving the price down on the back of FUD about the 'Tokyo Whale' about to dump 160k more Bitcoin because he's been recklessly selling using market orders.

But the latest market share numbers from Jon Peddie Research indicate that AMD can punch above its weight. __ The two graphics specialists have been engaged in a bitter war for GPU market share, and AMD had the upper hand toward the beginning of 2017. However, its Vega graphics cards turned out to be disappointing. They consumed more power, didn't deliver enough performance gains, and weren't priced competitively enough. Still, AMD managed to make gains against its larger rival during the holiday quarter. Let's see what happened and why. __ Image source: AMD.com __ AMD's discrete GPU market share expanded to 33.7% during the fourth quarter, up from 29.5% in the prior-year period, with NVIDIA commanding the rest.  __ This growth in AMD's business, despite an unappealing product line-up, seems surprising at first glance. But a closer look at this space explains why the chipmaker made so much progress. By now, it's well-known that GPUs are playing a crucial role in the mining of cryptocurrency, and this has turned out to be a big catalyst for AMD. __ In fact, Jon Peddie estimates that cryptocurrency miners bought more than three million discrete GPUs last year worth $776 million. AMD is touted to be the biggest beneficiary of this demand, as NVIDIA made a conscious decision to shift its focus toward gamers. The prices of graphics cards were shooting through the roof as most of the supply went toward satisfying cryptocurrency demand, leaving limited inventory for actual gamers. __ As such, NVIDIA reportedly told its retail partners to give preference to gamers instead of miners when selling GPUs by limiting the number of units that can be purchased at one time. This likely pushed that demand in the direction of AMD. In fact, crypto mining could have added anywhere between $75 million and $100 million to its revenue during the third quarter of 2017, according to available estimates. __ So while NVIDIA kept the interests of the gaming community in mind, AMD catered to the cryptocurrency market by offering special GPU drivers for mining last year. And the company recently announced that it's going to replenish thin GPU supply by ramping up production. __ As AMD tries to take advantage of this new demand, recent trends in GPU sales indicate that the momentum will work in its favor. Last quarter, mid-range GPUs accounted for 51.7% of total shipments, a substantial increase from the 41.5% share seen during the year-ago period. __ By comparison, high-end GPU sales increased only 4.5 percentage points year over year. The greater appeal of mid-range graphics cards makes sense when top of the line offerings like AMD's RX Vega 64 graphics card, which originally cost $500, sells for over $1,000 at major retailers like Newegg and Amazon. The same goes for NVIDIA's flagship GTX 1080 Ti -- originally priced at $700, units are selling for close to $1,000 online. __ As AMD directly pursues business from the cryptocurrency miners by releasing specialized drivers and not placing any restrictions on sales, it has the opportunity to continue winning market share as the year progresses. But is this heightened demand here to stay? __ Saxo Bank analyst Kay Van-Petersen, who correctly predicted last year's massive rise in Bitcoin prices, forecasts that there is much more upside to be had this year. If more miners join this digital gold rush, the increased GPU demand should pave the way for AMD to catch up even further to NVIDIA. __  __ John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

 __ A lot of things can change over the course of nine years. In the Bitcoin world, we have seen major changes as well. While there is still work to be done, these are still the early stages of cryptocurrency in general. Adoption will only increase moving forward, as the best has yet to come. __ It has become evident Bitcoin has seen some interesting changes. Things have evolved in an interesting direction compared to nine years ago. It is safe to say the currency has come a very long way since the initial release. What started out as a niche project has turned into the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Moreover, cryptocurrency is now a phenomenon which can’t be ignored any longer. __ As of last year, banks finally started showing an interest in Bitcoin. With a few institutions venturing into the world of Bitcoin futures, the tone is set. Other institutions even publicly acknowledge Bitcoin is a threat to their business model. All of this further confirms the best is yet to come for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. __ At the same time, some problems have remained. Bitcoin still lacks scaling, it’s not the most technologically-advanced solution, and it is losing traction among early adopter merchants. However, that doesn’t mean people will stop using Bitcoin as a payment method all of a sudden either. In fact, it seems now is a good time to stop thinking about Bitcoin as just an investment vehicle. __ The big question is how this industry will evolve over the next nine years. Right now, there is so much focus on the Bitcoin price, people tend to miss out on the big picture. Over one in two Square merchants is willing to experiment with BTC payments. That is an extremely positive signal for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole.When the merchants pay attention to BTC as a currency again, big things will happen eventually. __ Survey Shows: Over 50% of Square merchants is ready to accept #Bitcoin. Think #Bitcoin adoption is slowing down? Think again. Adoption of Technology in the US including #Bitcoin: pic.twitter.com/PCp9h1HW4E __ — Blockchainlife (@Blockchainlife) March 17, 2018 __  __ Moreover, the world’s leading cryptocurrency is maturing in the technology department as well. Scaling is becoming less of an issue with SegWit adoption on the rise. Add the Lightning Network to this trend, and things will only get better from here on out. Additionally, Rootstock is nearing completion. This project will bring smart contract technology to the Bitcoin network. __ Additionally, we see the public perception of this cryptocurrency change as well. Adults are becoming aware how BTC can be a part of everyday life without too many problems. The global and borderless nature of this currency has a lot of potential when used properly. The industry also continues to create jobs left, right, and center, which should not be overlooked either. This is still the early stage of development, and a lot of things will change in the years to come.  __ First. __ *jealous*
*takes time to shout: “HODL, TO THE MOON!” __ “After a Slow Start.” __ A slow start. Bitcoin. Slow. Slow start.  __ Seriously… you are trolling, right? __ Typical crap from the crypto-community. What do you expect? __ I havn’t seen “a loss” yet(HODL), the only people that are worried this month are the ones that are just getting into it, and don’t understand how crypto works, it is a slow year so far… considering it’s crypto… just wait, the FUD can only keep it here for so long, than once all the whales are properly positioned; TO THE MOON! __ This chart is ridiculous. Blockchain is here to stay, but Bitcoin is done. __ Trading “coins” is kind of like trading regular currencies…. except crypto will always be benefiting from the inflation that fiat suffers from…. and with fiat already on it’s way out… __ Of course people traded companies, those were the “machines” that added the value to society, with crypto we no longer have that centralized chunk of operations that we “bet” our money on based on the competence of the companies(etc), now we’re trading around different “new” forms of currency, trying to shelter from the bad news, and gain on the good….. __ Now instead of buying RUB/YEN to shelter your “cash” holdings from bad USD circumstance, or buying gold to shelter from fiat falls, you can put your bet on an: immutable, eternal, unique asset, one that will continue to function as a means of transfer well after the banks are dead and gone… __ A whole bunch of “first edition” “limited prints” have been produced, all of which seem to add value to society in their own way, filling their niches…… the volatility is here to stay for as long as humans CAN trade these sorts of things…. Now imagine working for 100$ 50 years ago, putting it in a shoebox, waiting until today, than opening it and realizing that your weeks pay was now only worth a days pay…… don’t trade your BTC for pizza, the “model-T ford” may have seemed expensive when it was first produced, but they’re worth more today than they were than….. humans collect things, it’s a hobby for the rich and powerful. __ Also: pricecheck “Black Lotus MTG”…. why it’s worth more than a BTC I’m not sure….. __ Copyright © 2018 - NewsBTC.

At press time, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $8,346.50, which is well off its all-time high of over $20K. Likewise, Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $608.65, Ripple (XRP) at $0.68, Litecoin (LTC) at $164.10, and Cardano (ADA) at $0.17 — all significantly lower than their peaks a few months ago. __ Nevertheless, financial professionals reported optimism to Citigate. 54 percent noted that they expect the valuations of cryptocurrencies to rise over the next 12 months, citing increased regulation and adoption as positive drivers in price. On the other hand, 32 percent expect a drop. The same percentage of respondents also expect a “dramatic” increase in cryptocurrency valuation from now until 2021. __ Citigate Dewe Rogerson executive director Phil Anderson told City A.M.: __ At the start of the year, the market capitalisation for cryptocurrencies was around $800bn (£577bn), but by 2021 over half of the financial professionals (59 per cent) we interviewed expect it to be over $1 trillion, while 15 per cent anticipate it to be more than $2 trillion. __  __ This positive sentiment mirrors that of others in the financial industry — like Bitwise Asset Management Vice President of Research and Development Matt Hougan, who stated last month his belief that cryptocurrency is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. Hougan explained: __ The road between now and trillions of dollars will be extremely rocky … we could get there in a few months. We could get there in a few years. We could go down 50% before we get there … [but] I think the pathway to a trillion dollars eventually is fairly certain. How we get there is going to be volatile and uncomfortable. I think we’ll get there pretty soon, though. I wouldn’t be surprised if we ended the year with an accumulated market cap over a trillion dollars. __ Are you planning on increasing your cryptocurrency portfolio, or are you looking to simply hold on to what you’ve got?

A day doesn't seem to go by without seeing articles and discussions about the technology. According to PwC executive Seamus Cushley, approximately $1.4B has been invested in blockchain just last year. In Gartner's recent hype cycle for emerging technologies, blockchain is approaching the peak. It is considered by Gartner as one of the ‘Key platform-enabling technologies to track.' While there is a lot of ‘hype vs reality' discussions going on, there is no arguing that blockchain is being taken very seriously across industries and cannot be ignored. (more...) __ Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, and Nanocrime __ James Carlini - Bitcoins are a digital cryptocurrency and have been around since 2009. As a substitute for legal tender, they are becoming a rage for investors and others but because there is no government agency auditing or performing regulatory oversights, you wonder if it is the perfect breeding ground for electronic nanocrime? __ Since the introduction of the Bitcoin, some competitors have emerged and the whole segment of cryptocurrencies are defined as Altcoins. Altcoins include: Dogecoin, Ethereum, Feathercoin, Litecoin, Monero, Novacoin, Peercoin, and Zetacoin. Some of these cryptocurrencies are considered improvements on the original Bitcoin algorithm structure, and they are gaining some traction as well. __ Some financial experts and analysts, including Warren Buffett and Ben Stein, are leery of the overall cryptocurrency market. Is it because it doesn't fit into their more traditional due diligence framework when reviewing investments? Or, is it something that they realize needs a whole new set of analytic and regulatory tools that are currently not available? (more...) __ Blockchain Is Changing the Retail Industry __ Nate Vickery - Blockchain offers impeccable security with its cryptography-based decentralized system as well as the plethora of possible uses retailers could exploit in the near future. __ In a world of increasing cyberattacks, internet fraud and online hacking, blockchain comes as a breath of fresh air. With its encrypted data and decentralized network system, it's a thorn in every hacker's side. Generally being associated with the finance sector, blockchain is now taking retail by storm. It's on a course that will change the retail industry as we know it. But how exactly is it going to achieve such a feat? __ First of all, what is blockchain? Well, blockchain is a digital ledger which stores its data in the form of interlinked blocks. Each block contains a timestamp of its transaction along with the transaction data. The links between the blocks are secured by using encryption, which prevents data modification of any kind. And once the data is in, it cannot be deleted, unless every previous block (to the one being modified) is deleted along with it. Moreover, it uses a decentralized network system for distributing its data, which means it cannot be remotely accessed, or hacked, from any central point. In short, blockchain is perfect transaction tool. (more...) __ Bitcoin Growth and Blockchain Disruption __ Simon Dixon - BnkToTheFuture.com is the largest online investment platform for investing in FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies.

Absolutely, because today's blockchain is opening up a pathtowards the delivery of trusted online services. __ To understand this statement, you need to see blockchain as more that it's more famous bitcoin use case. As a fundamental digital tool, blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. If used in this fashion, it can enable transactional applications that can have embedded trust, accountability and transparency attributes. Instead of having a Bitcoin blockchain that is reliant on the exchange of cryptocurrencies with anonymous users on a public network, a Business blockchain can provide a permissioned network with known and verified identities. With this kind of transactional visibility, all activities within that network are observable and auditable by every network user. This end-to-end visibility, also known as shared ledgering, can also be linked to business rules and business logic that can drive and enforce trust, openness and integrity across that business network.  Application built, managed and supported through such an environment can now hold a verifiable pedigree with security built right in that can. (more...) __ Register ▸ Here (Early Bird / Group Registration SAVE $200)  __  __ DXWorldEXPO LLC is a Lighthouse Point, Florida-based trade show company and the creator of DXWorldEXPO - Digital Transformation Conference & Expo.

It surpassed 45 million players in January and has been enjoying steady growth since, smashing numerous records. Together with Playerunknown’s Battlegrounds, the game has financial analysts and investors worrying for other video game companies. __ KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst, Evan Wingren, has said that the game could create a “tactical risk” for other publishers, who could suffer from a drop in engagement numbers. According to CNBC, Wingren wrote in a recent note to clients that the growth of Fortnite could “limit potential upside to consensus numbers.” __ “The game is gaining momentum in Western markets, which is likely to impact engagement for all AAA games to some degree,” explained Wingren. “We believe Fortnite is growing the overall gaming TAM (total addressable market), but some cannibalization is likely.” __ Wingren also suggested that publishers could experience a drop of up to 10 percent in monetization revenue. __ These thoughts have been echoed by Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak, who recently pointed out that Grand Theft Auto Online is facing stiff competition from Fortnite and PUBG. It is expected that Take-Two will see a drop in in-game monetization as a result. __ Others suggest that Call of Duty and Overwatch publisher Activision should start worrying, if it hasn’t already. __ CNBC reports that in recent weeks, Google search volume for Fortnite exceeded that of Minecraft and Bitcoin. The game has also received attention from celebrities across the globe, who have been bragging about their wins online. __ [Source: CNBC, Seeking Alpha]"

Gox Denies BTC, BCH Sales Affected Crypto Markets","Receive all Cointelegraph news immediately in Telegram. __ Cointelegraph __ The infamous, now defunct Mt. Gox exchange has published a new update denying its trustee caused a dip in crypto markets selling BTC and BCH to pay back creditors. __ Breaking __ The trustee of Mt. Gox – a once major and now defunct Bitcoin exchange – who reportedly sold over $400 mln in Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) around the new year has stated that he does not believe the sales affected the market prices of BTC or BCH, according to a report released today, March 17. __ Today’s report is a transcript of a Q&A at the 10th Mt. Gox creditors’ meeting, which took place on March 7, 2018, about the selling of BTC and BCH by defunct exchange’s trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi. __ The Japan-based Mt.Gox crypto exchange had been the largest in the world until a February 2014 hack led to the loss of around 850,000 BTC. The current sales of BTC and BCH by Kobayashi are part of an attempt to refund users who lost money in the hack. __ An earlier report released March 7 to the Tokyo District Court had said that the BTC/BCH sales took place between the creditors’ meeting in September 2017 and the one on March 7. However the report released today clarifies that the sales took place between December 2017 and January 2018. __ The March 7 report, which detailed the amount of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash sold by Kobayashi over this reported two month period, led many to believe that the large sell off is what led to the market crash after the new year. __ Kobayashi noted that after consulting with cryptocurrency experts, he “sold BTC and BCC [BCH], not by an ordinary sale through the BTC/BCC [BCH] exchange, but in a manner that would avoid affecting the market price, while ensuring the security of the transaction to the extent possible.” __ Kobayashi added a clarification about the transfers of BTC and BCH to different addresses, underlining that he did not necessarily sell BTC and BCH at the same time as these transfers: __ “Please refrain from analyzing the correlation between the sale of BTC and BCC [BCH] by us and the market prices of BTC and BCC [BCH] based on the assumption that the sale was made at the time the BTC and BCC [BCH] were transferred from BTC/BCC [BCH] addresses that I manage, as such assumption is incorrect.” __ It is possible that today’s report was released as a way for Kobayashi to refute accusations of his responsibility in the crash, as many in the crypto community had analyzed the times of the transfers of BTC and BCH in an attempt to correlate them with drops in market price during the same period. However, Cointelegraph did find that a comparison of the transfers and the price showed that there was a negative correlation in the short run, daily. __ Kobayashi reported that he sold the two coins at what he believes to be a fair market price, and picked the timing of sale “following consultation with the court.” Kobayashi also noted that he sold BTC and BCH separately, and added that there is no determination yet on future sales of the remaining BTC and BCH. __ A recent Reddit post summarizing Kobayashi’s position from today report’s has garnered conflicting opinions. Reddit user riveriafrank commented on the post that “just because you transact on a dark pool doesnt [sic] mean the price isnt [sic] affected.” Another Reddit user, samonx, the author of the post, added an alternative explanation for the market dip in the past couple months that does not include Kobayashi: __ “Large holders sold at a high price driving the price down on the back of FUD about the 'Tokyo Whale' about to dump 160k more Bitcoin because he's been recklessly selling using market orders. It all turned out to be complete b******* as I suspected. Someone else was dumping and manipulating in this way.

Morris,2018-03-17T16:47:40Z,"Bitcoin Miners Can Now Be Charged Extra for Electricity, New York Power Authorities Say","The New York state Public Service Commission has ruled that power companies can charge higher rates to cryptocurrency mining operations, which have moved into the state’s north to take advantage of low-cost hydropower. __ The ruling, reported by industry news site Utility Dive, was announced on Thursday. The New York Public Service Commission said the decision was needed “to prevent local electricity prices for existing residential and business customers from skyrocketing.” According to the commission, cryptocurrency mining operations can use “thousands of times” more than an average residential customer, and in some cases account for 33 percent of municipal utilities’ total demand, without commensurate local economic benefits. __ Cryptocurrency mining consumes huge amounts of electricity to power servers which solve complex math equations, recently raising environmental concerns. This “proof of work” process is part of the security structure of digital currencies like Bitcoin. __  Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. __ The New York decision came as one of the affected towns, Plattsburgh, temporarily banned new Bitcoin mining operations. Plattsburgh residents had seen their electric bills surge as rising total demand forced the purchase of more expensive, non-hydropower electricity. __ As Ars Technica points out, arbitraging cheap power is a widespread business tactic in industries as diverse as aluminum production and marijuana cultivation. China became a hub of Bitcoin mining in part because of cheap hydropower there, but power authorities there also moved to cut off supplies to cryptocurrency operations last November."

Investments are assets that provide goods or services that are valuable to someone and generate cash flow.

However, their volatility provides unique opportunities to find undervalued coins with major events in the next two weeks. The 5 Altcoins To Beat BTC Returns this Week are SNOV, ZER, MTH, ETH & MTL. __ This week’s altcoins worth shifting immediate focus to all have very exciting upcoming events. The market correction the last week allows for these coins to be attained at a huge discount from their all-time highs. This week’s coins requiring immediate attention include SNOV (Snovio), ZER (Zerocoin), ETH (Ethereum), MTH (Monetha), and MTL (Metal). __ These five cryptocurrencies have major announcements, events, presentations, and platform updates prior to the conclusion of March. Events of this magnitude provide a catalyst to boost the price of the underlying cryptocurrency in the immediate short term. __  __ Between the five highlighted cryptocurrencies, technical analysis points to the highest short-term returns coming from ZER (Zerocoin has the smallest market cap and largest percentage decrease since January) or SNOV (releasing their marketplace prior to the end of the month). __ Utility increases the value of the underlying crypto with the top gainers from the past month all having dramatically increased their utility (LTC, DGB and BCPT). Many of the cryptocurrencies on this week’s list intend to dramatically increase their utility which should result in an immediate increase of the crypto’s value. __ The market the past week has opened up many buying opportunities in the crypto space, especially for altcoins. The last ten days have been filled with multiple FUD events that continue to pressure crypto markets downward. These events have dramatically impacted the price of altcoins this week (some more than others): __ These four events shifted the market cap of the entire crypto market from $470 billion March 5, 2018, to $330 billion Friday, March 16. However, a decrease of over 30% in total market cap provides for some true bargain altcoins. __ SNOV is a smaller market cap cryptocurrency that specializes in decentralized lead generation. The platform rewards contributors in tradable SNOV tokens. However, this platform and concept are strictly hypothetical. Until the SNOV marketplace is released within the next two weeks. __ SNOV has promised to have their marketplace launched by March 31, 2018 (or earlier). Currently, the SNOV token has no utility excepts its ability to be traded. In under two weeks, the SNOV token will greatly increase its utility once the marketplace is launched. __ Tokens are useless without an actual utility. With a coin price of $.03 and a market cap of $13 million, it is likely SNOV sees exponential gains when they release their marketplace and establish utility for their token within two weeks. The goal is not to purchase SNOV the day before marketplace release, but with enough time to enjoy the price increase leading up to it. __ ZER is the smallest market cap crypto on this list and truly has the highest likelihood of an exponential climb in the coming weeks. They are valued at $0.93 per coin with a market cap of $2.5 million. January 9, 2018, saw ZER surpass the $12 per coin mark. That means while BTC and most coins have corrected 40-70%, ZER has fallen over 93% since its all-time high. __ Currently, ZER is only listed on one exchange and its catalysts for a major increase in value are their upcoming announcements of a major exchange listing and a new wallet. __ ZER has promised to have their mobile wallet released and a large exchange announcing the listing of their crypto by March 31. ZER’s utility is about to increase significantly. The addition of a wallet while boosting volume and publicity with the announcement of a new exchange will greatly increase ZER’s short-term value. The ZER team and concept are both impressive and revolutionary. This week should provide a huge boost to ZER’s value with a wallet about to be released and a major exchange listing announced. __ The SEC’s reiterated news was horrible for ETH wasn’t it? It depends who you ask. The general public and overall market sentiment will be screaming, “the SEC news was horrible for ETH.” __  __ This is not necessarily true. It was horrible for the short-term price evaluation of ETH causing it to tumble even more than BTC during the prior two-week period. However, more regulations in the crypto space are not bad for Ethereum in the long-run. __ If ETH continued to release ICOs that turned out to be scam or fraud related they very quickly would lose their reputation of being one of the most reputable in the business. The SEC getting involved may diminish their business in the immediate short-term but should allow for many more, legally started, ICOs in the near future. __ ETH is currently valued at $611 with a market cap of over $60 billion. March 4, 2018, ETH was trading at $865 and since the ‘negative’ SEC news has fallen more than 25%. Normally market cap coins of this magnitude do not make the “altcoin” list. __ However, with ETH having overreacted to the most recent SEC news they are likely to experience a significant boost in value in the short-term. ETH is one of the few cryptocurrencies with teams and the financial backing to attend any conference they chose. __ This week was no different as the co-founder of ETH, Joseph Lubin, presented as a Keynote speaker for the South by South West (SXSW) conference in Austin, TX. Clearly, blockchain technology is here to stay and cryptocurrencies that overreact to current events are prime opportunities for above-average returns in the short-term. __ MTH falls into the category of adding utility to their token in the next two-week period. MTH is fairly clear that the date of their first product will actually be March 31, 2018. Many of the other cryptos on this list state “March 31 or earlier” MTH is specifically for the 31st. Timing is everything in crypto as it is essential to have purchased prior to the date of the important announcement. In this case, their first product milestone on March 31, 2018. __  __ MTH is valued at $0.10 per coin with a market cap of $22 million. Adding the slightest bit of utility will dramatically increase both of these numbers. January 12, 2018, MTH was trading at $0.59 more than 500% higher than where it is priced today. The largest milestone in MTH’s development is occurring in two weeks yet the price is 80% lower than where it was in January. __ Look for MTH to rapidly appreciate leading up to their product milestone March 31, 2018. __ MTL is about to release MetalPay. Without MetalPay currently, MTL has no utility. Their token can be traded on exchanges but besides that cannot be used for anything. __ When MetalPay is implemented the utility of the MTL token increases along with the underlying value of MTL. The concept behind MTL is incredible. Most crypto currencies transactions speed are ‘slow’ compared to MTL with all having fees above MTL’s. This is because MTL plans to pay the user to send crypto. Yes, they actually intend to reward users up to 5% for each purchase they make using MTL, with no transaction fees. __ MTL is turning the crypto world on its head by inversing the current fee structure. Instead of there being exorbinant fees to transfer crypto, now merchants and individuals using MTL will actually receive a multiple percentage dividend each time funds are sent or received. Their CEO Marshall Hayner is one of the top figures in the crypto space and will continue to push MTL towards a successful launch of MetalPay. __ MTL was trading over $10 in January and is currently $3.67 per coin with a market cap of $81 million. Following the successful release of MetalPay their January highs should be quickly approached as MTL will revolutionize the fee structure of sending crypto. __ The number one factor that determines a cryptocurrency’s value is the underlying utility. ETH was able to buck the trend of collapsing crypto markets through most of January. This was because ETH was still regularly sought after for use in ICOs, Ethereum Dapps, etc. __ ETH remained valuable due to ETH’s utility. Each of the coins listed have important reasons their utility dramatically increases in the following two weeks. As the dates of their utility increase approach, the value of the corresponding currency should similarly increase. Altcoins can expect a dramatic increase in value following the successful launch of a platform, announcement of an exchange, or any other major update increasing a coin’s utility. __ The next few weeks have major events planned for: ETH (Ethereum),  SNOV (Snovio), ZER (Zerocoin), MTH (Monetha), and MTL (Metal). The recent market correction has allowed their prices to be extremely desirable leading up to their major events. __ To read the King’s prior articles, to find out which ICOs he currently recommends, or to get in contact directly with the King, you can on Twitter (@JbtheCryptoKing) or Reddit (ICO updates and Daily Reports). __ What are your thoughts on these altcoins?

The rate at which supercomputers are taking over the financial sector is leaving no doubt that the future of finance will largely depend on computer scientists and big data experts rather than the traditional financial advisors and traders. __ It is no wonder that the world top financial institutions are now hiring more quantitative analysts and computer scientists than the traditional financial analysts and investment advisors. The CFA Institute, the provider of the world most prestigious professional designation for financial analysts, has realized that it is no longer business as usual in the industry and is now including AI, Big Data, and Machine Learning in its Curriculum. __ On the other hand, Blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies, is also having its fair share in the industry with analysts predicting that it will do to the financial system what the internet did to the media. Cryptocurrencies as an investment asset have seen explosive popularity since 2016 with Bitcoin the mother of all cryptocurrencies soaring above 1,500% in 2017 before crumbling 63% in the first month of 2018. Other cryptocurrencies (as of now there are over 2000 of them) are seeing the same level of growth and volatility, creating massive investment opportunity on the one hand and big risk on the other. __ As the amount of data on these digital currencies continues to pile up, crypto-traders are finding it hard to find investment insights manually. This has prompted the emergence of AI and Machine Learning driven solutions. The application of computer algorithms driven by AI and Machine Learning to analyze big data and execute stock trades is not something new in the mainstream financial markets. __ AI and Machine Learning can be applied in the crypto markets in similar ways to the way it’s used for data analysis. The key advantages of algorithm-driven investment decisions include speed and accuracy, which are the two most vital elements to success in the highly volatile crypto markets.  Also, machine-driven trading does not require the trader to have specialized skills in a certain discipline or to have insider information to compete. __ For instance, Signals, a blockchain platform launched on the Ethereum Network, seeks to utilize Machine Intelligence in order to enable crypto traders to make smarter and faster trading decisions and maximize trading profits. With the Signals platform, both the experienced and inexperienced crypto traders can access trading algorithms ranging from traditional technical analysis to the sophisticated machine learning techniques. __ Another example is Robo Coin Advisor, a platform that has been work in progress since 2014. The projects, which claims to be the first robo-advisor for cryptocurrencies, combines AI with cryptocurrencies and blockchain to provide investors with daily forecasts and statistics relating to cryptocurrencies and their tokens. __ But how can we be assured that the trading algorithms are accurate and will make the right call when subjected to a lot of varying data? The answer can be found in back-testing. The process involves subjecting the algorithm to historical data in order to determine how it would perform in various scenarios. Platforms such as the Quantopian have been providing back-testing avenues for stock-trading algorithms and some are now offering such solutions for crypto trading. __ Another aspect of algorithmic investing that is bound to benefit crypto traders is market scanning for tradable news. In high-frequency trading, Computer algorithms equipped with Natural Language Processing are taught to scan and identify tradable news as it develops and execute trades instantly. This approach can be very helpful in crypto-trading given the crypto-markets volatility and sensitivity to emerging issues. __ For instance, in the recent past, news on regulatory crackdowns has proven to have a very big impact on the price movement of cryptocurrencies. With an algorithm that is trained to identify regulatory crackdown news as they emerge and instantly execute trades, traders can profit on their crypto holdings both on the bull and bear markets. __ As blockchain and cryptocurrencies continue to gain traction in the mainstream society, the amount of data generated from related activities and transactions will keep growing. Long-term investors and day traders must, therefore, be ready to embrace cutting-edge technology if they are to remain competitive in this industry. __ Tags: AI, analytics, Blockchain __ One of the biggest causes of downtime and data loss comes not from hackers or other nefarious activities, but from massive power blackouts that are caused by faulty equipment or machine “downtime”.

Sixteen candidates were competing for the presidency of the African country, which has been the first in the world to test blockchain technology for a presidential election. __ Sputnik discussed the test blockchain technology for a presidential election with Leonardo Gammar, CEO of the Swiss blockchain company Agora. __ Sputnik: Could you tell us more about this Sierra Leone experience with the use of blockchain technology in the elections? __  __ What you have to understand that what we did in Sierra Leone is not a full implementation of the digital voting system, from A to Z people are supposed to register themselves, show their ID to the small device or to the webcam showing the reflection of their ID and receiving a private key, speaking, saying random things and to be sure it is not recorded and it's live, and after it's done you receive an encrypted key and you vote on your phone, which is not necessarily your phone, because you only need the key, one phone can allow the whole village to vote, if you don't have a phone you can borrow someone else's phone or you can go to a public internet cafe and even polling stations where the government can provide iPads or computers. It's only the last vote that counts meaning that if someone comes up to you and says, hey, I give you ten quid and you vote for this guy, as long as the event is open you can change your vote and you can show that person that you actually voted for his candidate and when he leaves you can change your vote as long as the event is open.  __ Of course, every vote is anonymized and encrypted every one-fifth is shuffled every one-fiftieth of a second one over five zero and sent to the blockchain. You can challenge your vote, you can see that your vote went on the blockchain, you can see it going on the blockchain, and, of course, no other information is available for someone else than you, and we have these nodes of our blockchain that will verify, audit the election, our blockchain is a bit different from proof of work of the first type of blockchains because it is very difficult to update the blocks on a small device when the ledger is super heavy, with Ethereum and Bitcoin you have to download the whole ledger, and it's super heavy on a small device so with our blockchains it's proof of sign and maybe this is a bit technical, but you only have to download the logarithmic parts of the block so it makes it less heavy to run, this incentivizes people to vote on small devices, of course, they can vote on computers is they want to. __ READ MORE: Quantum Blockchain: How Physicists Will Stage a Cryptoworld IT Revolution __ Sputnik: In your view what are the prospects of blockchain when it comes to electoral process? What are its main advantages? __ Leonardo Gammar: Two main advantages, it's not black-boxed and it's not a centralized black-box, meaning the information and the block is shared by the whole network, so no one can change the result, everything is written and it's written forever. __ This is something very important, it's written on the blockchain and it's written forever and nobody can change it if you want to try and change it you have to have all the network at the same time which is very difficult. So I would say compared to electronic voting machines or compared to the centralized voting system it's much safer, there's less skepticism. __ I can give you another example and we don't need to go to Africa, we can take the example of Spain and Catalonia. In this case put yourself at the place of the executive power in Madrid, the pro-independence party for the autonomy of Catalonia want to run a non-constitutional referendum in your country, so what you want to do is you want to avoid your citizens go to the referendum, not to give it legitimacy, so you do your best so the people in the country don't go there and don't vote, and it was quite a success because most people that went to vote were people from the independence side, the one who organized the vote, and the people who counted the vote are from the independence side. __ READ MORE: Russian Creator of Largest Quantum Computer Predicts How Tech Will Change World __ The European Union, since Spain is a member of the EU, didn't really approve that referendum and didn't provide any observation of what happened, didn't even go there, I think, so didn't approve that referendum, so I understand the skepticism of Madrid when the independence party comes out and says 80%, 90% voted for independence. But try to also put yourself at the place of the independence party and the people that voted, no one came to register their vote, check their vote, observe their vote and they really wanted to prove to the international community, to the European Union that didn't come to Madrid, to the other members of the European Union, to Scotland, to the world, that these votes were real people, these numbers were real people and in both cases a solution where blockchain is implemented you have less skepticism and you have less questionable results. So if I had to say, and, of course, cost savings are very important, I would say faster, trustable, easier, because when you vote remotely it's much easier for you, you don't have to queue for 8 hours. __ The views and opinions expressed by Leonardo Gammar are those of the expert and do not necessarily reflect those of Sputnik. __  __ The fact of registration and authorization of users on Sputnik websites via users’ account or accounts on social networks indicates acceptance of these rules. __ Users are obliged abide by national and international laws.

									Venture advisor, 4x entrepreneur, marketer & strategist. I live in Toronto, curate a lot, blog a bit, and help startups. __ As the circle of general public awareness around cryptocurrencies grows further, additional new opinions from newcomers start to get formed around what they represent and what they don’t. __ To use an old analogy, cryptocurrencies and the blockchain are like a big elephant. If you come to it with your eyes blinded and not knowing what to expect, your first impression will depend on what part of the elephant you have first touched. __ First impressions matter. And one of these first impressions we often hear about cryptocurrencies is bewilderment that they aren’t backed by anything, followed by the deduction: “how do they amount to being worth anything”? __ Newcomers are deducting these early impressions, based on their partial experiences as the whole truth. But the reality is far from it. __ Then, these distorted thoughts are amplified when we hear a public figure calling “crypto a crock” at a US House hearing, or when we read ludicrous reports trying to explain why Bitcoin Could Fall Below $1,000 with preposterous claims like “there is no value in it.” __ Of course, like anything in life, our current traditions influence and limit the optics of how we see things. __ We are used to governments being the sole sovereign backers of national currency, and we are used to relying on financial institutions as the sole providers of sacrosanctity on financial transactions, because all roads lead to a bank or a government. __ However, there is a news flash that changes all of this, and challenges these two long-held traditions. And the stakes are very high on the outcome of these changes. __ If you put aside what you don’t understand about the blockchain, you just need to remember the simplest and most fundamental novelty behind it: the valid transmission of transactions without the involvement of financial middle parties. And that is the more important revelation about the new world of cryptocurrency. __ So, the next time someone tells you: “cryptocurrencies are not backed by anything, they are like thin air”, your response should be to change the conversation to what the blockchain enables, instead of what cryptocurrencies appear to be. You could say: __ “For the first time, we have a new technology that allows the final settlement of financial transactions between any two parties without the involvement of financial intermediaries.” __ Imagine the implications of that statement. Imagine if financial and value-based transactions for any type of asset could be settled directly from one entity to another, while at the same time maintaining valid records of such transactions. __ Doesn’t that give us promise for a new financial system that is more efficient than the current one? This technology is systemically disruptive, which is why it is facing headwinds from incumbents who want to cling to the old system. __ But don’t go the rabbit hole of critiquing sovereign governments who are the current money authorities, or attacking the banks who currently maintain our accounts and move our money. Frontal attacks are not useful, and rarely effective. It is better to surround the incumbents and make their market shares smaller while making them gradually irrelevant, by growing the number of cryptocurrency users and raising the general public’s awareness and openness about the technology’s promise. __ By opening people’s minds further, the rest will follow. __ I believe for the first time we have the opportunity to change the circulation issues of currencies. A Block-chain with a DAO  makes it possible to have a perfect accounting system. Transparency creates reputation. We have to move from the mindset that monetized tokens need to circulate. For the first time it is possible that any body can monetize anything. I am getting really exited about this and I believe that this change in mind set will make a crypto usefull to the masses. this method will eradicate the need for fees, ICO`s , taxes etc.   https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b28c85571722466d553c141d87643e44f8503f49a1bcf02ba8e71058dc098fb.jpg"

As a substitute for legal tender, they are becoming a rage for investors and others but because there is no government agency auditing or performing regulatory oversights, you wonder if it is the perfect breeding ground for electronic nanocrime? __ Since the introduction of the Bitcoin, some competitors have emerged and the whole segment of cryptocurrencies are defined as Altcoins. Altcoins include: Dogecoin, Ethereum, Feathercoin, Litecoin, Monero, Novacoin, Peercoin, and Zetacoin. Some of these cryptocurrencies are considered improvements on the original Bitcoin algorithm structure, and they are gaining some traction as well. __ Some financial experts and analysts, including Warren Buffett and Ben Stein, are leery of the overall cryptocurrency market.

With its encrypted data and decentralized network system, it's a thorn in every hacker's side. Generally being associated with the finance sector, blockchain is now taking retail by storm. It's on a course that will change the retail industry as we know it. But how exactly is it going to achieve such a feat? __ First of all, what is blockchain? Well, blockchain is a digital ledger which stores its data in the form of interlinked blocks. Each block contains a timestamp of its transaction along with the transaction data. The links between the blocks are secured by using encryption, which prevents data modification of any kind. And once the data is in, it cannot be deleted, unless every previous block (to the one being modified) is deleted along with it. Moreover, it uses a decentralized network system for distributing its data, which means it cannot be remotely accessed, or hacked, from any central point. In short, blockchain is perfect transaction tool. (more...) __ Bitcoin Growth and Blockchain Disruption __ Simon Dixon - BnkToTheFuture.com is the largest online investment platform for investing in FinTech, Bitcoin and Blockchain companies.

Absolutely, because today's blockchain is opening up a pathtowards the delivery of trusted online services. __ To understand this statement, you need to see blockchain as more that it's more famous bitcoin use case. As a fundamental digital tool, blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. If used in this fashion, it can enable transactional applications that can have embedded trust, accountability and transparency attributes. Instead of having a Bitcoin blockchain that is reliant on the exchange of cryptocurrencies with anonymous users on a public network, a Business blockchain can provide a permissioned network with known and verified identities. With this kind of transactional visibility, all activities within that network are observable and auditable by every network user. This end-to-end visibility, also known as shared ledgering, can also be linked to business rules and business logic that can drive and enforce trust, openness and integrity across that business network.  Application built, managed and supported through such an environment can now hold a verifiable pedigree with security built right in that can. (more...) __ Register ▸ Here (Early Bird / Group Registration SAVE $200)  __  __ DXWorldEXPO LLC is a Lighthouse Point, Florida-based trade show company and the creator of DXWorldEXPO - Digital Transformation Conference & Expo.

 __ According to reports from a local news source, the Oberhausen police in German arrested a suspected dealer who is said to have sold drugs on a large scale in the city. Explicitly, for months, the man is said to have made drug deals with his main culprit in Oberhausen clubs and also in his apartment in the Marienviertel. Indications on drug trafficking led the police officers from Commissariat 12 to track down the man. In the wake of acquiring a warrant, the officers searched his apartment in Marienviertel and found in addition to other things, more than 1,100 Ecstasy pills, as well as hashish, LSD and intoxicating mushroom mixtures, which is evocative of a general store trade. The suspect is said to have ordered the drugs from the Darknet markets and paid for them with Bitcoin. __ Furthermore, the search and arrest of the man were made February 28, however, the police have now, in fact, arrested two people thus, the main suspect who is 21-year-old and an 18-year-old culprit. Nevertheless, the supposed culprit has also been in custody since March 2 as the police continue investigating. __ German officials fight against illicit drug shops on the darknet __ The issue of unlawful drug-related trades and activities in German has been a major concern for the German Police. Just last year, we saw many arrests of people who dealt in this unlawful trade such as the German police arresting a 29-year-old man associated with trading opiate tranquilizes in the worldwide online drug ring, and arresting another three suspects in a German drug lab bust. The Darknet is the main space for unlawful drugs and mostly traded with Bitcoin. This has alarmed the German Police and state units to fight against such darknet marketplaces and to bring them down. Due to this, about 139 German Police together with the Koblenz Attorney General and State Central Office for Cybercrime, in December, invaded properties in Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia, taking down 13 online drug shops. __ The system or ‘gang’ as depicted by NRW police sold drugs through the clearnet and darknet to a few thousand clients. At one area in North Rhine-Westphalia, police discovered in excess of 30,000 pre-bundled units of different illegal substances. Investigations revealed that five crucial suspects made and established online drug shops. They utilized the shops to offer new psychoactive substances (NPS). “The gang had practical experience in ‘synthetic cannabinoids’ and ‘amphetamine-like’ substances. A considerable number of vendors sold originator drugs as “bath salts” or “plant manures.” However, the full degree of the gang operation remains obscure, even to police, until the point when the investigation prompts extra suspects and target areas. The German officers checked 12 properties regarding 10 suspected individuals of the drug trafficking organization. __ Nonetheless, four suspects in December arrived in police custody. The house and property search led to the exposure and seizure of about $3,000,000 worth of different resources. The officers grabbed various PCs, digital storage mediums, and cell phones. They seized packing material, shipping supplies, and 50 ‘moving boxes’ loaded with 30,000 pre-bundled packs of designer drugs. However, the investigators said the gang sold the drugs between $15 and $30. __ The German court authorities maintained the arrest warrants for the suspects, who were caught in an early morning assault. Since the underlying assault, extra suspects may have been arrested, as one police press release incorporated a recent arrest regarding the drug trafficking system. German authorities told the press, the assessment of the proof has “recently started”. Despite the fact that the attack was a “devastating blow” for the drug trafficking system, the investigation has a longer way to go before finishing. __ The Koblenz Prosecutor’s Office declared that the police expect more arrests and seizures for the situation in days and months to come. Germany is presently focusing on NPS dealers because “man-made psychoactive substances can be to a great degree unsafe.” Currently, the number of deaths following their utilization in Germany soared to 98 in 2016 and now soaring even higher.” Therefore, anybody arrested will face charges in connection with infringement of the Narcotics Act and the New Psychoactive Substances Act. __ Your email address will not be published.

 __ The European Union recently adopted laws embodying a proposed “right to be forgotten,” to protect individuals from eternal memorialization of unfortunate past indiscretions. However, I feel it’s time to propose a complementary “right to remember,” to ensure that history cannot be erased or rewritten at the whim of those who control the systems we use to communicate, plan, and lead our lives. __ Recent court cases have shown that the largest, most powerful companies controlling the internet are willing to take extreme positions regarding their right to control data after it’s been made public. They abuse ambiguous, out-of-date US legislation such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to threaten and punish companies that dare to collect data that is explicitly intended for public view. They also employ sophisticated software to thwart and discourage automated collection of data they deem undesirable. (My company is currently involved in such litigation against LinkedIn.) __ The potential harm here goes way beyond the success or failure of a few small Silicon Valley startups. To keep the powers that be accountable, we need to support and protect the right to view, archive, and make available information that was made public in the past. No individual, company or government has the right to restrict access to information of note that was publicly available at any point. No one has the right to fiddle with history. __ Data is made public when people want to disseminate that data broadly — to publish it. Platform designers can specify what data stays behind a wall (available only to explicit “users” who have signed up and signed in) and what data is made freely available for search engines, individual users, or — presumably — anyone with an interest and a connection to the internet. __ What rights does the public currently have to this supposedly public data? In most countries, that question can be framed through an understanding of the principle of copyright. Copyright is a form of monopoly control afforded to creators of “original work,” to ensure that those who have invested considerable time and effort to develop that work have the ability to profit from it. It’s important, however, to understand the limitations of copyright. From the US Government Copyright Office: __ Copyright does not protect facts, ideas, systems, or methods of operation, although it may protect the way these things are expressed. __ Copyright protects the artistic expression of a concept, not the underlying ideas, theories, facts, or observations. __ There is also a principle called fair use (US) or fair dealing (other places): __ In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. — Stanford University Library __ But assuming the use is within the confines of existing copyright law, it seems kosher to archive for posterity publicly available data on the World Wide Web that is accessible through a browser without a username and password — or another access-control mechanism. To do this at any meaningful scale, you would need to automate the task, programming computers to browse (scrape, crawl, collect) this data in ways similar to how a search engine operates. __ Websites use a (non-standard/defacto) protocol to inform “robots” — automated systems as opposed to humans with a visual browser — how the sites would like them to behave. At every major website, you can see this in action simply by typing “/robots.txt” after the URL. Many websites use this file to allow crawling by major search engines such as Google and Bing, but explicitly discourage automated data collection in general.  __ Websites encourage search engines to catalog their pages because they want their content to be seen, to be “discoverable.” They are actively promoting the dissemination of their data by encouraging the dominant search engines to index their site and push them up to the top of search results. __ Let’s think about this for a moment. If someone suggested a protocol that said you could view a website only if you worked at a short list of companies, that person would rightly be pilloried. But what the typical robots.txt file says is exactly that — except it applies to automated viewing as opposed to human viewing.  __ The deciding factor should not be whether you view the data using one piece of software (a popular browser) or another (a script you wrote in a programming language such as Python). The issue should simply be, do I have a right to copy (save, archive, collect) this publicly available data? __ Various attempts have been made to archive the internet and web, the best known being the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which tries to keep a record of websites as they existed at certain points in time. It’s polite to a fault — until recently, it would never catalog pages unless their robots.txt file allowed it. (In fact, the Internet Archive has removed access to archived sites when the present version of the site prohibits crawling — retroactively erasing historical data).  __ The Internet Archive is a nonprofit group that depends on private donors to fund its operations. It’s unlikely it has the resources or ideological disposition to fight protracted legal battles should a major platform decide it doesn’t want certain pages archived. __ With the advent of javascript-heavy websites — that act more like applications than document-oriented web pages — and the adoption of mobile apps, archiving the web is getting harder all the time. But that’s all the more reason it needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. Leaving this job (including decisions as to what to archive) to a single nonprofit seems like a bad idea. __ There are some countervailing currents. Technologies such as public key encryption and blockchains — which underlie Bitcoin, Ethereum, and similar platforms — are poised to enable secure, decentralized, trusted identity, and transactions. They could also be used to widely distribute and put a digital seal on information, ensuring that no one could rewrite or erase the past to suit their purposes, or take credit for works they did not create. __ The fox cannot guard the henhouse. All the big players — Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Amazon, and so on — actively “monetize” this data. Google analyzes your searches. Facebook studies your social behavior. Amazon keeps track of your purchases. They then use this data to bring you targeted ads and purchasing opportunities. __ It seems rather cynical and self-serving for these companies to collect all of this valuable information, make it public to ensure it’s searchable and monetizable, and then turn around and complain when third parties attempt to collect the same public data and redistribute it, either in its original form or analyzed, aggregated, and made searchable in new and interesting ways. __ There is a device in the Men in Black series called the neuralyzer. The agents use this fictional gizmo to wipe out the recent memory of bystanders who have witnessed classified information such as alien lifeforms or spacecraft. __ Let’s keep that thing fictional. __

It seems every criminal and their pet is working on some way to use other people’s computing resources to mine Monero or other currencies. Some app developers integrate this option to provide access to premium features. One such app made its way onto Apple’s App Store, but it has since been removed.  __ Malicious cryptocurrency mining has become quite popular over the past six months. In most cases, criminals will try to infect computers with malware designed to use their victims’ computer resources to mine various cryptocurrencies. This doesn’t mean they are mining Bitcoin, as Monero has proven to be a more than popular solution these days. We’ve seen an influx of Monero mining malware, which seems to mainly be targeting Windows users as of right now. __ One exception comes in the form of a Mac app known as Calendar 2. Although this is a calendar application first and foremost, it also hijacks the user’s computing resources to mine Monero in the background. According to Apple, this particular app puts “heavy strain” on users’ devices, mainly in the CPU department. __ Some users have even reported that the Calendar 2 app uses nearly all of their CPU power to mine cryptocurrency on behalf of an unknown individual. This is a very worrisome development, although one user pointed out that the malware in question uses a Monero miner. For now, it seems this application has been successfully removed from the App Store, although it is unclear whether additional malicious apps exist. __ Even though the calendar functionality of this app works as advertised, there is an option to gain access to premium features. Those looking to enjoy such features but without paying can donate their CPU resources to mine Monero. With the app consuming a lot more CPU power than advertised, users have been eager to point out that this app essentially hijacks one’s computing resources.  __ Apple has now removed the app due to a “violation of the guideline 2.4.2”. More specifically, applications on the App Store should never purposefully drain a battery, generate heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. Since the app was removed, the developers of Calendar 2 have removed the Monero-mining feature altogether, as they are not certain why it was using so much CPU power in its current form. It now seems to be a matter of time until the app is reinstated without this feature. __ Unfortunately, it appears we will see more and more applications of this type in the future. While the option to opt in was received well by users at first, not having an option to opt out has always been a pressing problem, for obvious reasons. As the Calendar 2 debacle goes to show, integrating this feature for the right reasons can still have disastrous consequences in the long run. __ JP Buntinx is a FinTech and Bitcoin enthusiast living in Belgium.

57,http://bitcoinfr.biz/netnewsledger-global-economy-faces-cybercrime,,2018-03-17T13:05:00Z,Netnewsledger - global economy faces cybercrime challenges mercado bitcoin taxas," __ LONDON – TECHNOLOGY – What are the biggest challenges that the global economy faces over the next few decades? War? Terrorism? Climate change? Add to that list cybercrime. Cybercrime causes trillions of dollars of damage each year to the global economy. In the next 48-months cyber-crime is expected to rise to $6 trillion per year in economic damage, double the amount from 2015 bitcoin logo. In focus, today includes: Rapid7, Inc. (NASDAQ:RPD), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) __ To put that in context, the U.S. real estate industry is the largest segment of the U.S. economy, at $2.2 trillion in revenue. __  In other words, cybercriminals will be destroying three times more value than the revenue of the entire U.S. real estate industry. And they will do it every single year. __ No wonder Ginni Rometty, IBM Corp.’s Chairman, President, and CEO, told an industry conference“cybercrime…is the greatest threat to every profession, every industry, every company in the world.” __ But companies face a technological problem: the standard software packages sold as “security” are no longer sufficient for keeping billions of dollars of sensitive corporate information protected. Today’s cybercriminals are highly sophisticated and ruthless, necessitating a much more robust cyber defense. __ Only one cybersecurity company – public or private – has military-grade cyber security software and is headed up by a management team with experience in working in the intelligence community, Wall Street and corporate America. __ Hill Top Security Inc. could be about to see its business take off google wallet bitcoin. Hill Top has a military-grade, cybersecurity platform for small-to-medium-sized businesses (SMB), comprising blockchain event validation, cyber tagging, incident response and rapid restoration. It is currently in the process of being acquired by Big Wind Capital ( BWC; BGGWF). __ Recently, the WannaCry virus attacked Microsoft Windows operating systems in May 2017, a global attack that ensnared hundreds of thousands of computers around the world, demanding $90 million ransom in bitcoin. __ And the costs can be more than money. The UK’s National Health Service became one of the most prominent victims of the global WannaCry ransomware attack, which forced the health system to shut down hospitals, divert ambulances and rendered patient records unavailable for a period of time. __ The truth is we are seeing a bull market in cybercrime. There are an estimated 1.5 million cyber-attacks each year, or about an average of 4,000 every single day, 170 every hour, or almost three every minute what is the current bitcoin price. That means, by the time you finish reading this article, a handful of cyber-attacks will have occurred. The average cost of a cyber breach in the U.S. stood at about $7 million in 2016. __ By 2021, the economic damage from cybercrime could reach $6 trillion. In other words, the cost of cybercrime will be bigger than the value of the entire global trade for major illegal drugs. __ Companies now realize they have no choice but to budget for cybersecurity meaning of bitcoin. About 60 percent of small and medium-sized businesses are forced to shut down within six months of a cyber-attack, according to the National Cyber Security Alliance. __ As the cyber threat mushrooms, spending on defense is set to rise exponentially and will exceed $1 trillion from 2017 to 2021, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. The cybersecurity market will grow by12 to 15 percent each year through 2021. __ Because the threat is becoming more sophisticated, the solutions will need to become more complex as well. Most cybersecurity software is simplistic and reactive, meaning that cybersecurity vendors only update their software with solutions after an attack happens. They are band-aids, not cures. __ It is world’s first company sophisticated enough to meet the U.S. Department of Defense’s rigorous FIPS-FIAR standard for financial transactions bitcoin prepaid card. The software was originally developed for the intelligence community to detect financial anomalies but has been transformed into a platform called Vauban, a highly sophisticated cloud-based product that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to constantly improve. It gives companies a chance to detect problems, risk score issues when they are found and block attacks before they occur. __ Hill Top’s Vauban software is a unique, military-grade solution that has Blockchain event validation for secure cryptographic validation. Hill Top also has the only platform that provides full and immediate operational recovery after a security breach bitcoin mining hardware in india. The company’s cybersecurity package is probably in a class by itself. __ The Hill Top (BWC; BGGWF) management team is stocked with cyber-security and software development, experts who have worked throughout the Department of Defense, the Department of Treasury, Silicon Valley and Wall Street __ The CTO is Neil Wright, also a West Point grad, who went to Wall Street and then to UPS as the company’s Chief Architect, where he developed software for package reconciliation and anomaly detection. __ Tom Gilmore, the COO, is a veteran of the Marine Corps and has extensive experience working with the intelligence community. He also started and sold a small defense systems integrator that made the Inc. 500 list of fastest-growing private companies. __ In short, the team is experienced and has a track record of success across multiple sectors, including the military, the intelligence community, Wall Street, Corporate America and even startup ventures. __ Hill Top Security (BWC; BGGWF) already has government contracts in place for several million dollars. Because it is one of the only companies that have software compliant with DoD’s FIPS-FIAR standard, it hopes to be at the front of the line for future government contracts. __ But the real money will be made in the private sector, where Hill Top is seeking clients among small and medium-sized enterprises that need to acquire more sophisticated cyber-security technology. The company has cash in the bank and, because the Vauban software is ready to go, there are fewer costs to scaling up. __ More importantly, its upside is enormous bitcoin news now. Hill Top is still small, and few investors know about it. The company expects its commercial revenue to eclipse the value of its government contracts in the next 12 months. There are over 27 million small and medium-sized businesses, meaning the market for this kind of cybersecurity could exceed $2.2 billion by 2020. If Hill Top captures only a small slice of that, it could be worth many multiples of its current valuation. __ Cybercrime is one of the most challenging threats of our time…which means companies offering solutions have the potential to be among the most lucrative. With companies and governments set to spend trillions on cyber defense in the coming years, there is a lot of money to be made. __ But Hill Top/Big Wind Capital ( BWC; BGGWF) has a cybersecurity platform that outpaces its competitors what’s bitcoin. The software has artificial intelligence that allows it to constantly learn and stay ahead of the curve. It detects threats and prioritizes responses. And it allows for immediate recovery after an attack. The company is small, and the upside is enormous bitcoin confirmation time. Hill Top’s extensive military and intelligence DNA give it a leg up in the rapidly evolving cyber-security market. With government contracts in hand and a commercial line that is growing quickly, investors in the know will see a massive opportunity. __ Rapid7 Inc (NASDAQ: RPD) is a huge player in security and information technologies. The company’s special, analytics-driven approach to cybersecurity and IT operations give it an incredible advantage over its competitors bitcoin io. The company’s in-depth knowledge of the threats facing businesses’ physical, virtual, and cloud-based assets allow for high-quality service which puts Rapid7, Inc ahead in the field. __ Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ): With a market cap of over $657 billion, this is the second-largest by market capitalization in the S&P 500. We love Alphabet because its foundation is intellectual property-not tangible assets. Oh, and self-driving cars … definitely a huge part of the innovation in energy and artificial intelligence. As an early entry into the self-driving car world, Alphabet’s innovations have paved the way for a transportation revolution. Alphabet is set to continue to bring value to its investors and even as one of the largest companies in the S&P 500, Google’s parent company continues to reach new heights. __ PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the leading innovator in online banking and electronic transactions, PayPal acquired a new product in 2014: Venmo, an electronic repayment software, which found massive appeal for people looking for an easy way to split bar-tabs, payback friends and move money easily back and forward between accounts. __ The company has some 184 million active users and 14.5 million merchants. In 2015 it generated $9.2 billion in revenue and its stock has been soaring for years. The price has ticked up 70 percent in 2017, leaving its old parent eBay in the dust and indicating that the company, which used to be a limited platform for online transactions, has moved into the next phase of its lifespan. __ Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) One of the biggest bankers in the U.S. is embracing the revolution in artificial intelligence. Along with ‘big data,’ AI will completely change the way markets are monitored, assets are managed and trades performed. __ Embracing this new tech should set BOA above and beyond its competition, though Citigroup and other major bankers have shown little hesitation in getting into new tech themselves. The race is on to see which financial firm gets the most out of artificial intelligence, and which will be left in the dust. __ Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the most innovative and well-known companies within the tech sector, but its Windows platform is the most widely used operating system on the planet. First launched in 1985, Windows has shaped what is expected from a personal home computer. __ But Microsoft is appealing to investors for more just its Windows platform. Like Intel, Microsoft is diving headfirst into an entirely new market. With key partnerships utilizing and implementing blockchain technology, the company’s upside could have huge potential as the tech takes off. __ "

With their successfully operating VitalBet platform, the GIFcoin team plans to execute this vision with participants being rewarded with profits. __ GIFcoin’s history began way back in 2011, when a team of experts came together to create a number of products related to the affiliate marketing space. What they then realized was the potential behind betting and gambling affiliate programs as the most profitable. After building their initial business through betting and slowly exiting other affiliate spaces, the team entered the U.K markets, increasing both their affiliate catalogs and profits. __ Plenty of projects in the cryptocurrency space share their concepts and raise money all while rarely providing any deliverables. The GIFcoin team have already created their core product, VitalBet, which operates to this day as a successful online betting website. Covering all major sports, VitalBet soon after its launch introduced Bitcoin as a payment option and began to rub shoulders with the cryptocurrency community. __ At the moment, VitalBet is one of the few bookmakers to accept cryptocurrency and will soon accept a plethora of digital assets after development is funded through their ICO. The initial integrations will see the platform add Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Dash, and other liquid digital assets as time goes on. __ One of the main pitfalls users face when interacting with online betting websites is unintelligent designs coupled with clunky user experiences. The GIFcoin team plans on outfitting VitalBet with a simple-to-use, aesthetically pleasing design to allow users to process their transactions on the platform with ease and simplicity. __  __ VitalBet’s path to success has already been outlined by the team and it includes large advertising campaigns, license applications, a new affiliate program, an upgraded staff, and plenty of payment options. By turning VitalBet into a household brand through sophisticated marketing techniques, they are sure to capture a wide audience to start using their platform. __ With a $484 billion market contained in the online gambling space, capturing a slice of that with innovative techniques and smart engineering should be an easy bet to place on GIFcoin and VitalBet. __ VitalBet has already made a splash in the online betting industry, by placing as the 71st highest ranking bookie on the internet against other online betting platforms. Their vision includes continually moving toward the top, as the team projects that they will be one of the top 15 bookmakers online by 2020. By combining an efficient platform along with their projected milestones, VitalBet is poised to truly take over the online betting space. __  __ At the center of the platform is GIFcoin, which will grant participants and holders access to 80% of VitalBet’s annual net profits once a year. The distribution phase will involve a full report that is conducted initially, followed by an annual profit share in Ethereum. GIFcoin’s plan to audit and distribute involves a full snapshot of the blockchain right before the distribution period. ICO participants will be notified in advance on the GIFcoin website, and by email. __ The GIFcoin sale features 300,000,000 total tokens with 10,000,000 already being sold out. The sale has a soft cap of 5,000 Ether and a hard cap of 24,000 Ether set in order to be able to build out their gambling investment fund. __ GIFcoin is currently in the first stage of their main ICO. There are seven stages in total, each with its own bonus and token threshold: __ For more information about GIFcoin please be sure to check out their website.

 __ The immutability and decentralized nature of public blockchain networks, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, could allow governments to process large amounts of sensitive information on an unchangeable and transparent platform. __ In an exclusive interview with Binary District, Daniel Gasteiger, the co-founder of Procivis, an electronic ID solutions company built on integrated e-government platform eID+; and Patrick McCorry, a Research Associate at University College London (UCL), discussed the potential of blockchain technology in e-governance and the limitations that may restrict its applicability. __ Over the last two years, several governments, including those of Brazil and Georgia, have utilized blockchain technology to manage electoral votes, land registry and digital identities. While many countries have fallen behind Brazil and Georgia in the adoption of blockchain technology, the governments of Japan, South Korea, and the US have vowed to continue exploring the value of the technology in e-governance. __ As a data processing technology, blockchain is largely applicable to many of government’s functions and services. Gasteiger explained that blockchain technology could replace existing infrastructures and methods, such as electoral votes and the digitization of ownership. __ “The blockchain further allows governments to digitize their registries, for instance, land registry, commercial registry or marriage registry, and it can facilitate the secure allocation and distribution of social benefits. By implementing these applications, governments can foster public trust and increase citizens’ engagement,” said Gasteiger. __ The application of blockchain technology in e-voting and the real estate registry would see governments processing millions of transactions on a public blockchain network daily. This could, in turn, increase the potential and facilitate the adoption of blockchain commercially. __ Gasteiger further reiterated the importance of the immutability and decentralization. These two characteristics give blockchain a significant edge over existing technologies because it ensures that information is readily accessible and allows both the government and the public to verify that it has been unaltered. Moreover, this is all recorded in a transparent ledger without the fear of hacks or security breaches. __ “The blockchain’s characteristics of immutability and decentralization offer two crucial advantages. First, the validity of any official document stored on the blockchain can be reliably verified at any time. Second, the decentralized nature of the blockchain allows governments to digitize their services without the need to create a central storage for sensitive data, sometimes called a honeypot, which would represent an attractive target to hackers,” added Gasteiger. __ However, immutability and decentralization come with huge costs and tradeoffs — namely scalability. While public blockchains are extremely secure and virtually impervious to security breaches because they are distributed and don’t have a single point of failure, they struggle to process large amounts of data at fast speeds. In order for data to be sent and received on a blockchain network, every node on the network must synchronize to ensure that each piece of information is verified and confirmed. __ By eliminating miners and processing information within the network through stakeholders, the migration from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol algorithm could ease the burden on nodes and users. In a PoW-based system, miners use electricity and computing power to solve blocks and process information. In a PoS-based system, miners are nonexistent and those holding that cryptocurrency can process data without the need for electricity and computing power. __ The principle of PoS is based on the idea that stakeholders or holders of the cryptocurrency will not deliberately make negative decisions for the network. On this issue, Gasteiger noted that the migration of public blockchains, like Ethereum, to PoS could improve scalability __ “There are still key aspects of the blockchain value proposition that the current technology doesn’t yet deliver on. For instance, the move from proof of work to proof of stake is still outstanding, a step that should increase performance and scalability. In addition, I believe the right equilibrium between a fully-decentralized and a more centralized development paradigm for public blockchains still has to be found.” __ Despite the wide range of applications blockchain technology could power, UCL researcher Patrick McCorry has stated that scalability is still the primary issue for any public blockchain. __ Ethereum remains the most flexible and scalable blockchain network in the global cryptocurrency market, settling more than 1.3 million transactions a day according to Etherscan. As such, it has a daily transaction volume larger than that of all cryptocurrencies in existence combined, including bitcoin. __ Even with Ethereum’s flexible blockchain network, it doesn’t have the capacity or efficiency to fit hundreds of millions of votes on the blockchain. At this time, public blockchains can only handle around a million transactions a day. For instance, if the Brazilian government was to process its popular petitions on the Ethereum blockchain, which it plans to do in the future, only around 500,000 votes could be processed a day. __ Given its obvious inefficiencies, governments have begun exploring methods which could enable blockchains to process large amounts of information outside of the main blockchain network and then simply send a compilation of information to the blockchain. __ In the recent testing of its Ethereum-based electoral system, the Brazilian government utilized a system called hashing to combine all daily votes into a single transaction and broadcast it to the Ethereum blockchain network. Systems like hashing allow blockchains to process large amounts of information in chunks, compile it into one transaction and, ultimately, process it much more efficiently and at a lower cost. __ McCorry, however, maintains that the system employed by the Brazilian government only solves the specific issue of time-stamping. He emphasized that it does not solve the problem of scalability as a whole. __ “This is mostly to do with time-stamping and committing to a set of votes in such a way that the Brazilian government cannot remove or add votes in the future. I think it is honorable that they have attempted to add further integrity to their electoral system using the Ethereum blockchain, but it only solves this one issue. It does not help solve ballot stuffing or authenticating voters. That depends on the voting protocol being used by Brazil,” said McCorry. __ He asserted that he is not convinced of the applicability of blockchain technology in e-governance or why it is better than traditional database replication techniques in the management of votes, land registry and digital identifications. __ “It can provide some benefits in terms of proving to the general public that data has not changed over time (i.e. by time-stamping and committing to data). However, I’d be wary of the government collecting information about the general public and storing it in the blockchain. I’ve not really been convinced why this type of data needs to be stored on a blockchain or why it is suitable for this purpose compared to traditional database replication techniques.” __ Henrique Costa, a law professor at Universidade de Brasília, who is currently an advisor to the Brazilian government on the testing of Ethereum blockchain network in processing electoral votes, gave a contrasting opinion. In regions like Brazil where corruption remains a serious issue, Costa said that the blockchain could bring legitimacy to the country’s electoral system by processing information transparently. __ Costa added that, in Brazil, there is no secure method of gathering votes and signatures from the people when processing popular petitions. In this system, a regulatory proposal can be heard in Congress if the signatures of 1 percent of Brazil’s population are obtained. The blockchain could be used to manage these popular petitions along with other important aspects of the country’s electoral system. __ While McCorry believes that e-governance is a compelling use case for blockchain technology, he still holds that, for now, blockchain has “very little” advantage over existing technologies. __ “It really depends on the application and sometimes it takes great imagination, intuition or experience within the sector to find a compelling use case,” explained McCorry. “A smart contract (and blockchain) works best when there are two or more mutually distrustful parties that wish to perform some shared computation. It works great for financial applications such as trading assets or currencies. So far, for e-voting and e-governance, it seems only useful for proving that data hasn’t been changed (i.e. time-stamping) or providing a consistent view to all voters.” __ Ultimately, there are no compelling use cases for blockchain technology that are better or more efficient than existing technologies. Nevertheless, as scalability improves, second-layer scaling solutions are implemented and blockchain is adopted by the e-governance sector, more convincing use cases of blockchain technology will likely emerge. __ This post was written by Joseph Young for Binary District, an international сollaborative technology community which creates unique competency-based workshops and events on new technologies.

 __ ICOs are big money and big news these days. From virtually nothing a few years ago to raising $5.6bn last year a totally new form of financing has truly arrived on the scene. This success has brought its fair share of pretenders, with “scam ICOs” becoming increasingly prevalent. __ How can investors protect themselves from scam ICOs – some answers have been proposed by one successful blockchain entrepreneur. First – it’s necessary to truly understand that an ICO has a strong day-to-day core executive team. Second – transactions in the ICO should be transparent, as today only a few ICOs actually show you all the incoming transactions during the tokensaleso this should be of paramount importance. Thirdly – discounts and special offers during a tokensale that seem too good to be true are generally just that – too good to be true. But even three simple rules aren’t enough for the shark tank of ICOs in early 2018. __ What might shine the path for “smart money” in the new world of crypto is the expertise of the old world of institutional investors when such funds highly selectively decide to support an ICO. Such investments have thus far been few and far between but that fact could well change this year. __ The core concept of a truly valuable ICO is investment in a decentralized network (rather than investing in a traditional corporation) and there is no reason why VCs wouldn’t be interested in such moves. __ Part of the attraction may lie in the fact that there is so little value to be found in traditional centralized companies. Tech IPOs were rare in 2017. Snap’s IPO raised almost $20bn last year, and paid its CEO $638 million. As Snap is clearly not some revolutionary technology, the lesson is clear – there is too much money chasing quite few quality companies in the traditional sector. The logical consequence of this is clear – VCs will move into new sectors such as crypto, augmented reality and virtual reality looking for value beyond the fantastical valuations at Snap and elsewhere. __ Which ICOs will be the ones to attract “old world” moneyand conservative private equity firms like Carlyle, Fortress, Ardian, Mangrove? Surely one of traditional investors’ most important criterions will be projects which are built upon the foundation of real world use cases where decentralized networks solve the shortcomings of traditional business models. With venture capital funds sitting on over $120bn in available funds for investment and traditional sectors such as metals & mining still underperforming, a hunt for yield is surely underway in technology. __ This change in attitude is possibly best exemplified by JP Morgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon who went back on his comments where he slammed Bitcoin as a “fraud”, to say that, in fact, he is a strong believer in blockchain(the technology behind the cryptocurrency).Dimon put it well, saying “[ICOs] you have to look at individually” . __ In 2018, institutional investors are sure to be looking at individual ICOs for value many times greater than offered by Snap and the like. __ Copyright © 2018 - NewsBTC.

After beginning the year with a relatively small aggregate market cap of $17.7 billion, the combined value of digital currencies soared by almost $600 billion, pushing to $613 billion by year's end, an increase of more than 3,300%. Chances are decent that investors may never see such impressive one-year gains from an asset class ever again. __ However, 2018 has presented some hurdles for cryptocurrencies. Regulatory concerns out of South Korea and China earlier this year wound up facilitating a decline in the aggregate virtual currency market cap from an all-time high of $835 billion to just $276 billion at its trough. In essence, the crypto market lost two-thirds of its value in roughly one month's time. __ Image source: Getty Images. __ Those challenges have continued beyond just concerns over increased regulation abroad. Over the past month and a half, two major advertising kingpins have announced that they would stop allowing cryptocurrency and initial coin offering (ICO) ads over their platforms. (An ICO is very much like an initial public offering for common stock, except it's for digital tokens.) __ At the end of January, the largest social media network in the world announced that it would be banning all cryptocurrency and ICO ads. In the announcement, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) product management director Rob Leathern said, ""We've created a new policy that prohibits ads that promote financial products and services that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices, such as binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency."" Considering that Facebook owns four of the top seven social media platforms by total users -- Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- this move to ban crypto ads was viewed as a major blow.  __ However, it wouldn't be the last blow for the crypto space. On March 14, Alphabet subsidiary (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google also announced that it would be doing away with crypto-related ads, and anything concerning ICOs, crypto wallets, and virtual currency trading advice, by June 2018. Said Scott Spencer, Google's director of sustainable ads, in an interview with CNBC: ""We don't have a crystal ball to know where the future is going to go with cryptocurrencies, but we've seen enough consumer harm or potential for consumer harm that it's an area that we want to approach with extreme caution.""  __ Image source: Getty Images. __ As highlighted in Google's new Financial Services advertising policy, it'll be disallowing ""[b]inary options and synonymous products"" and ""[c]ryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency related trading advice)."" __ While the news of Facebook and Alphabet taking a hard-line stance on cryptocurrencies might come as a bit of a surprise, and is mostly being construed as bad news, it's a bit of a double-edged sword when all is said and done. __ On one hand, banning digital currency advertisements makes perfect sense given that they're mostly unregulated and could cause financial loss to uninformed individuals who are lured in by advertisements promising big returns. If we've learned anything so far this year, it's that cryptocurrencies can most certainly head lower. In fact, most ICOs often fail to raise enough cash or interest to become viable long-term assets. __ We also know that the cryptocurrency market relies on new investors to help drive market caps even higher. It's a market dominated by retail investors, with institutional investors sticking to the sidelines and being unwilling to invest in decentralized exchanges. The loss of billions of impressions from Facebook's and Google's platforms may very well adversely impact crypto valuations in the future by reducing new investment. __ Image source: Getty Images. __ Then again, the actions taken by Facebook and Google also demonstrate that cryptocurrencies are becoming a more validated asset class. In an odd twist, an increasing amount of regulation -- even including the banning of crypto-related advertisements -- could help form a tangible foundation where these assets can gain the trust of investors. While most virtual currency investors fear regulation, as anonymity is what's made bitcoin and other digital currencies so attractive, added regulation of any form is actually a long-term positive for the cryptocurrency movement. __ What we don't know is what's next for the cryptocurrency space. It's possible we could see other major advertising players follow in Facebook's or Google's footsteps, or even see the Securities and Exchange Commission ramp up regulations. Either way, virtual currency investors shouldn't fear these actions taken by Facebook and Google. Instead, they should cheer them, as they're a means to help validate this burgeoning asset class and weed out digital tokens and blockchain projects that aren't operating in the best interests of their members. __  __ Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

 __ Even after a sharp correction earlier this year, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has remained unsustainably high, and techno-libertarians have continued to insist that blockchain technologies will revolutionize the way business is done. In fact, blockchain might just be the most over-hyped technology of all time. __ NEW YORK – Predictions that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will fail typically elicit a broader defense of the underlying blockchain technology. Yes, the argument goes, over half of all “initial coin offerings” to date have already failed, and most of the 1,500-plus cryptocurrencies also will fail, but “blockchain” will nonetheless revolutionize finance and human interactions generally. __

 __ In reality, blockchain is one of the most overhyped technologies ever. For starters, blockchains are less efficient than existing databases. When someone says they are running something “on a blockchain,” what they usually mean is that they are running one instance of a software application that is replicated across many other devices. __ The required storage space and computational power is substantially greater, and the latency higher, than in the case of a centralized application. Blockchains that incorporate “proof-of-stake” or “zero-knowledge” technologies require that all transactions be verified cryptographically, which slows them down. Blockchains that use “proof-of-work,” as many popular cryptocurrencies do, raise yet another problem: they require a huge amount of raw energy to secure them. This explains why Bitcoin “mining” operations in Iceland are on track to consume more energy this year than all Icelandic households combined. __ Blockchains can make sense in cases where the speed/verifiability tradeoff is actually worth it, but this is rarely how the technology is marketed. Blockchain investment propositions routinely make wild promises to overthrow entire industries, such as cloud computing, without acknowledging the technology’s obvious limitations. __ Consider the many schemes that rest on the claim that blockchains are a distributed, universal “world computer.” That claim assumes that banks, which already use efficient systems to process millions of transactions per day, have reason to migrate to a markedly slower and less efficient single cryptocurrency. This contradicts everything we know about the financial industry’s use of software. Financial institutions, particularly those engaged in algorithmic trading, need fast and efficient transaction processing. For their purposes, a single globally distributed blockchain such as Ethereum would never be useful. __ Another false assumption is that blockchain represents something akin to a new universal protocol, like TCP-IP or HTML were for the Internet. Such claims imply that this or that blockchain will serve as the basis for most of the world’s transactions and communications in the future. Again, this makes little sense when one considers how blockchains actually work. For one thing, blockchains themselves rely on protocols like TCP-IP, so it isn’t clear how they would ever serve as a replacement. __

            considers what the removal of presidential term limits will mean for the country's reform process.
         __ Furthermore, unlike base-level protocols, blockchains are “stateful,” meaning they store every valid communication that has ever been sent to them. As a result, well-designed blockchains need to consider the limitations of their users’ hardware and guard against spamming. This explains why Bitcoin Core, the Bitcoin software client, processes only 5-7 transactions per second, compared to Visa, which reliably processes 25,000 transactions per second. __ Just as we cannot record all of the world’s transactions in a single centralized database, nor shall we do so in a single distributed database. Indeed, the problem of “blockchain scaling” is still more or less unsolved, and is likely to remain so for a long time. __ Although we can be fairly sure that blockchain will not unseat TCP-IP, a particular blockchain component – such as Tezos or Ethereum’s smart-contract languages – could eventually set a standard for specific applications, just as Enterprise Linux and Windows did for PC operating systems. But betting on a particular “coin,” as many investors currently are, is not the same thing as betting on adoption of a larger “protocol.” Given what we know about how open-source software is used, there is little reason to think that the value to enterprises of specific blockchain applications will capitalize directly into only one or a few coins. __ A third false claim concerns the “trustless” utopia that blockchain will supposedly create by eliminating the need for financial or other reliable intermediaries. This is absurd for a simple reason: every financial contract in existence today can either be modified or deliberately breached by the participating parties. Automating away these possibilities with rigid “trustless” terms is commercially non-viable, not least because it would require all financial agreements to be cash collateralized at 100%, which is insane from a cost-of-capital perspective. __ Moreover, it turns out that many likely appropriate applications of blockchain in finance – such as in securitization or supply-chain monitoring – will require intermediaries after all, because there will inevitably be circumstances where unforeseen contingencies arise, demanding the exercise of discretion. The most important thing blockchain will do in such a situation is ensure that all parties to a transaction are in agreement with one another about its status and their obligations. __ It is high time to end the hype. Bitcoin is a slow, energy-inefficient dinosaur that will never be able to process transactions as quickly or inexpensively as an Excel spreadsheet. Ethereum’s plans for an insecure proof-of-stake authentication system will render it vulnerable to manipulation by influential insiders. And Ripple’s technology for cross-border interbank financial transfers will soon be left in the dust by SWIFT, a non-blockchain consortium that all of the world’s major financial institutions already use. Similarly, centralized e-payment systems with almost no transaction costs – Faster Payments, AliPay, WeChat Pay, Venmo, Paypal, Square – are already being used by billions of people around the world. __ Today’s “coin mania” is not unlike the railway mania at the dawn of the industrial revolution in the mid-nineteenth century. On its own, blockchain is hardly revolutionary. In conjunction with the secure, remote automation of financial and machine processes, however, it can have potentially far-reaching implications. __ Ultimately, blockchain’s uses will be limited to specific, well-defined, and complex applications that require transparency and tamper-resistance more than they require speed – for example, communication with self-driving cars or drones. As for most of the coins, they are little different from railway stocks in the 1840s, which went bust when that bubble – like most bubbles – burst. __

                Diamonds (for jewelry) are of very little utility, require enormous amounts of work to find and process, and they're still being traded at exorbitant prices. Mr. Roubini and Mr. Byrne could be arguing that the value of diamonds should fall to 0 as well. I believe the original purpose of the bitcoin concept was to provide an alternative to the state/bank complex. It was born in a time where demonstrably criminal banks were basically rescued with bailouts and impunity by the state, while regular people were thrown out of their homes. A trustworthy ledger, that bypasses banks and corrupt states seems to be a good idea, and I think it will have support by a lot of people, until such time that the state proves trustworthy and the balance of power tips back to the people. Naturally, the same frauds that hide billions in art and Manhattan apartments are also hiding their loot in bitcoin, and I suspect that these people will make damn sure that bitcoin does not drop to 0.

                Block Chain and Cryptocurrencies are not synonymous.
             __ 
                Crypto will die when a order forces an end to anonymity. As any student of the law knows, it’s of the transaction itself that is lawfully consecrated and recognized. It is the text agreements identifying all parties. If crypto becomes legally unenforceable and therefore not recognized, the state (like China) will effectively ban the activity.
             __ 
                The readily available information, to me, about Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, including that provided by financial notables on media such as CNN, has not allowed me to comprehend them in any real sense. So I am left with my own speculative powers to try to arrive at what they might possibly be and their possible consequences. Firstly, in my opinion, for them to have value in the financial markets -even in the fields of art or intellectual property- they must be a scarce resource. Secondly, this means that the rate at which they could be ""manufactured"" or ""mined,"" as the case may be, given that they have been loosely defined in the televised media, at least, as numerical solutions to complex mathematical problems, presumably defined by equations, must be naturally or effectively legally constrained to such a degree that their value in the secondary market not decrease, at least not monotonically, lest this failure lead to their crash with potentially devastating consequences on the larger economy, national or even global, depending on the capitalization levels reached at such times. Thirdly, they, each instance or coin, must be unique and thus distinguishable from every other, and their respective ownership distinctly attributable to a specific owner or group, and registered as such, for any real possibility of fraud or theft to be precluded in their design. Fourthly, they must not be allowed to be used in money laundering or drug trafficking or any illegal or proscribed activity, if they are not to eventually present a threat to global political, social, or economic stability or world order and development. This, for starters.
             __ 
                Using the Visa TPS claim shows that neither of you can even define what a 'transaction' is. Do you know what percentage of VISA transactions are actually settled and cleared in real-time? In most cases VISA/Mastercard will steps in and authorize the transaction on behalf of the issuer (up to agreed limits, per issuer, per card). From the consumer's point of view they may walk out the door with the goods in real-time, but from the issuer and merchant banks perspective the transaction isn't completed for hours perhaps days in the case of cross border purchases. You also don't address the cost of these services and the fraud they're subject to, to the global economy. I laughed loudly when you started talking about protocols, and with respect to SWIFT you failed to recognize that they have just completed their own DLT trials in a clear effort to catch up and maintain market share they're losing and could continue to loose to Ripple.

                I'm now posting a third comment, this time from my laptop computer, having twice attempted to post from my phone. It's an iPhone, and the mobile UI (user interface) made it impossible for me to see what I was typing as I typed in the comment box. I'm also unable to delete my own posts from Project Syndicate's comment section, so let me state for the record that the previous two posts were streams of consciousness, typed in the dark (unable to see what was being typed), and would be deleted if such an action was possible. This is a very poorly designed mobile interface, which is consistent with PS's general lack of aptitude with respect to all things digital.Articles like these - and the associated comments - just wreak of arrogant myopia, which of course comes from a place of deep insecurity about their understanding of the very real and overwhelmingly positive blockchain phenomenon. For the credibility of PS, I would urge you to stop granting non-technologists the privilege of condemning any new technology on your platform, unless they demonstrate a verifiable understanding of it. You may need to engage third parties - engineers - to help you with this.Here is a video of a lecture that addresses every single point these author's are trying to make, by Andreas Antonopoulos at MIT three years ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8y_GypCWf4Here's another great one from Andreas Antonopoulos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knkZptPZLzI&index=7&list=PL4pSAnIxgynxK2iv9WRHmvnpnZ-0aE7txProject Syndicate is wonderful in most regards.

                Blockchain and Crypto's are so over hyped, its a Mani larger than the Tulip Bubble, Internet Bubble, Emerging MKTS Bubbles and etc. In the end, as a bubble/Mania they end all badly return to where they started near or at Zero. But, you can't tell the public for they don't like people popping their dreams or taking the punch bowl away from a bunch of drunks

                What's your experience with blockchain? How much crypto do you own? I imagine you've at least been through one crypto purchasing experience if you're leaving such a comment? Which coin projects have you analyzed and what specific drawbacks have you identified?
             __ 
                This sober take on blockchain is very welcome. It is troubling that blockchain is nearly always celebrated without reference to latency and it's decentralizing aspects are emphasized without reference to capacity. A medium-sized securities exchange will have about 1,000 products being traded and its trade matching engine will have a capacity of of 50,000 to 100,000 transactions per second. Currently, this could not be replicated even if each participant holding a ledger maintained a server farm.  While the hype around blockchain is dangerous for investors, there is the merit that the wash of money should allow the technology to develop faster than it otherwise would, like many internet concepts and broadband connections did during the dot.com bubble.
             __ 
                Parts of the article are widely acknowledged - hype, failed ICOs, energy inefficiency, slow Bitcoin. Undoubtedly some are using blockchain where they could just as easily use a database + an API.One or two important arguments were missed. eg. the fact that neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum are sufficiently decentralized. In both cases three or four Chinese mining pools control more than 50% of the hashing power.Many of the arguments only apply to public blockchains, not the permission blockchains used in business.While certainly there's too much hype, some industries WILL be profoundly affected by blockchain. Insurance and Supply Chain are good examples. The hype is unjustified in many instances, and sometimes is borderline fraudulent. But in a few narrow cases there is a reason for the hype: where blockchain or DLT is a good match,  the inherent network effect of blockchains could see adoption at breathtaking speeds. But we haven't seen that so far. Yet.
             __ 
                This article is set amidst a context of a highly speculative Bitcoin (and other Crypto Currency bubbles). I understand the strong tendency to dismiss the Currency and the underlying Blockchain technology together. However, lets not get rid of the baby with the bathwater here. Lots of companies are already developing applications to do simple things like track assets in the real world. (Diamonds, Ships, shipping containers ). They are simple things -ostensibily but are hugely admin intensive because of the steps involved and number of parties. Secure permissioned blockchains do this job very very well.  As for speed, permissioned chains running on mainframes on secure partitions can be blindingly fast and low latency. You will see more of deployments of this in the coming year I think. Finally, the comment about US railways is apposite. remember many rail barons made huge fortunes, many went bankrupt, but they left behind a railway infrastructure that's still in use today. Similarly after the dotcom boom of early 2000s we had the same pattern and we still enjoy the innovation and infrastructure developed in that era.
             __ 
                Blockchain technology was all but known in the 70's, yet it only recently became deployable du to progress in hardware. What makes it extremely inefficient in the context of Bitcoin (and other ""cryptocurrencies"") is the childish proof-of work protocol simulating the gold standard.  On the other hand, the argument stating that techno bubbles leave after-bust viable infrastructure behind may be correct, yet it only confirms that capitalism inherently produces sub-optimal solutions.
             __ 
                This is possibly the worst constructed argument against censorship resistant distributed ledger technologies that I have ever read. It even compares DLT to spreadsheets.The use of historical bubble correlations like the railway / tulip / etc is not only naive but also historically inaccurate, with the same correlation, the internet is itself a bubble.  If his arguments were actually true nobody would have adopted Bitcoin. Here's an analogy, much more recent: The same arguments were given about video on the internet in 1999, luckily YouTube and hundreds of other video based startups ignored those naysayers and the rest is history.
             __ 
                Apart from saying it's nonsense and making a rather ridiculous comparison with video on the net you didn't controvert a single one of the substantive points raised in this piece. And no one has adopted Bitcoin really outside of speculators and those engaged in dubious transactions.
             __ 
                Here. Watch this before ever commenting on blockchain again:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8y_GypCWf4Engineers from MIT and all of the best engineering programs around the world have been working on this stuff for years. Bitcoin has been around for ten years. This is nothing like the internet.
             __ 
                wait ,what?""Bitcoin is a slow, energy-inefficient dinosaur that will never be able to process transactions as quickly or inexpensively as an Excel spreadsheet""I dont know about inexpensive,but for sure it not quick the excel spreadsheet..We all have gone for coffee while excel was loading after mistakenly clicking on the shortcut..What quick?..:):)
             __ 
                ""And Ripple’s technology for cross-border interbank financial transfers will soon be left in the dust by SWIFT, a non-blockchain consortium that all of the world’s major financial institutions already use.""This comment will not age well. I don't think you've done your research on Ripple and XRP. SWIFT's gpi doesn't solve the Nostro/Vostro problem. It's a slower version of Ripple's xCurrent, the foundation for xRapid, which does solve the Nostro/Vostro problem. SWIFT's gpi proudly claims that 50% of their transactions settle in under 30 minutes. Well, 100% of xCurrent and xRapid transactions settle in under 30 seconds.SWIFT's gpi is being used by only 10% of their clients, some 150 banks. Ripple's faster and more efficient software will be fully implemented by 150+ banks by the end of the year. SWIFT has been around since the 70's. Ripple has been around for 6 years and is already taking market share from SWIFT. It's no wonder many of SWIFT's upper management have moved to Ripple. Once again, your comment on Ripple will age very poorly. You probably talked to a contact you have at SWIFT and they told you they're not worried about Ripple (they are worried shitless) because they have a new system (gpi). You guys left it at that and never followed up on what Ripple really is. Tisk tisk.
             __ 
                It seems the main argument in this post is that blockchains are slow and can't scale. But that's glossing over the tremendous amount of research going into sharding mechanisms and side chain technology, which are being developed and tested right now. Also, brushing aside proof of stake as insecure without acknowledging the very serious fundamental research going into protocols like Casper and Ouroboros is not credible. Actually, it's at best incompetent and at worst dishonest. I wish you'd brought up arguments about flawed scripting languages so I could point you to Rholang and Haskell too. Your main argument, that most coins will fail and that speculation is driving prices right now is correct, in my view. But you let yourself down with a clickbait title and basic analysis. You naysayers feed off the frenzy like everyone else.
             __ 
                Oh... by the way... just so Nouriel doesn't loose sleep over the block chain conundrum... believe me when I say that technology will take care of solving all his technological and energy concerns... that ""bet"" you can place with absolute confidence!
             __ 
                But ""FAIL"" is a indispensable characteristic of ""all"" markets because, guess what?, they are ALL speculative and manipulated! (Stock market, OTC market, Derivatives market, Gold market and on and on). This, because real profits are not made in stable markets... they are made in ""Boom and Bust"" markets and hence every player in the market works hard to create the conditions for this to happen. Crypto currencies are basically playing the same game and there is no reason to believe that the players will not continue to do so for a long time... as a matter of fact, this is what makes crypto currencies so attractive and it would seem to me that sooner or later traditional market players will be eager to join the crypto currency market because they will be able to play anonymously without hurting the real economy... as they have for so long!... eventually the crypto market may very well become a big dogs playing ground!... and that is all I have to say about this!
             __ 
                I was unable to follow the  the arguments in this article.   There really shouldn't be much fuss around: the point of a blockchain ledger is merely to keep it trusted.  And nothing more.  The means to achieve that is where the innovation lies:  blockchain ledgers don't need a central authority to certify them (or chain of authorities).  Instead, their cryptographic distributed protocol does that for you.  That's it.Their impact, in the long run, is that a trusted blockchain ledger may survive any National or International  ""institutional"" authority.  I guess that is the reason why they are said to be meant to 'destroy' those institutions.
             __ 
                Except that the complexity of the transactions required to update a distributed data-base expands exponentially with the size of that database.  If nothing else the fight against global warming will limit the widespread application of Blockchain technology to general commerce.
             __ 
                I wonder, also, if quantum computing will make today's cryptographic schemes useless.  And, in general, compute capacity may grow exponentially, too.

87,http://bitcoinist.com/brave-new-world-crypto-revolution-individual/,Bitcoinist.net,2018-03-17T11:00:17Z,Brave New World: Why the Crypto Revolution Shapes the Modern Individual,"Real time prices""vires in numeris."" __ Bitcoin __ ETHEREUM __ NAGA __ Receive all Bitcoinist news in Telegram! __ As a college student, I often ask myself about where I stand amidst the overarching reach of our institutions and the demanding responsibilities of public life. While many everyday actions seem impermanent – or overshadowed by the immensity of the collective – I have been thrown into a circumstance where I have regained my status as a genuine individual. In the world of crypto assets, I have never felt so defined and well-placed. __ [Editor’s note: The following article is an op-ed by Antonio Grumser, an undergraduate student at Georgetown University and co-founder at Potomac Crypto Capital LLC.] __ For almost 150 years now, Americans have been fed a diet too heavily reliant on trust in arbitrary third parties. Our corporate environment – responsible for shaping individuals like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Elon Musk – has also hosted our nation’s most important discoveries and breakthroughs. We have created the world’s most influential financial institutions and have dominated the world economy for decades. But recently, the fallibility of our careful creations have started to reveal. __ For the most part, we must blame our allegiance to arbitrary third parties. Upon creating economic regulations, America developed a framework where credit rating industries and central banks could control the industrious entrepreneur. Due to institutions like these, big banks under failed leadership got saved from default, and unworthy bonds fooled Americans with their AAA ratings. __  __ Regulators like these  – ‘anointed’ and ‘divine’ in their original promise – have propelled us into two economic recessions and have created today’s uncertain political and economic dynamic. As a result, the individual has been overshadowed, and his freedom threatened. __ Although abruptly saying au revoir to the conventional and corrupt is dangerous, the most sincere attempt to fix their blatant failures is found in the crypto and blockchain space. Offering a technological platform and method of communication that is immutable and transparent, Bitcoin technology is destined to one day dominate the financial world. __ Instead of issuing our trust to a governmental institution or rating agency, we delegate it to the majority of the network’s nodes. Instead of waiting three business days for our banks to complete a wire, we prefer to wait only about 10 minutes for the transaction to clear in a completely trustless and transparent process. Instead of living with our private information being exposed to the public, we prefer a conveniently incognito but remarkably complete alternative. __ Bonjour, Brave New World. __ The world of crypto startups acts like a marketplace of ideas, and in this world, there is a strong legislative of opinion that continually gauges the legitimate values of these ideas. Creations like Bitcoin and Ethereum have become familiar names not only because of their brilliance but because of their applicability. __ While the fallacy that most crypto-creators are con-men perpetuates, we are blinded by mischievous governmental organizations. While it is true that some individuals in crypto arbitrarily create value and master pump-and-dumps, it is more the exception than the rule. In most cases, where the conventional and the modern diverge, the counterculture and the entrepreneur converge, creating precise solutions to real-world bureaucracy. __ You never change something by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. __ – Buckminster Fuller __ The tsunami of technology will continue to advance without regard. While security and individuality are bound to become dead corals in this sea of destruction, crypto assets and their blockchain underpinnings will enable individuals to maintain their identity and security while utilizing breakthrough tech. By using blockchain technology, healthcare, banking, and informational industries will be able to communicate and store information about individuals through safer and more efficient means. __ Cryptos redefine the collective in a way that places strict emphasis on individual components. While the meaning and functionality of the individual have become diluted by large government and their misconceptions of responsibility, crypto assets reintroduce the importance of the individual. __  __ In the crypto world, the individual is a completely autonomous unit, and if one chooses to engage in any transaction, it will be dealt in a decentralised manner. The beauty of crypto assets is that its decentralised approach creates a cautious libertarian efficiency. The individual – put on the highest of pedestals and designed to be the essence of every crypto formula – has finally redeemed its dignified place. Our insurmountable trust in the collective has proven to be our Achilles heel: the individual, after all, cannot be shadowed. __ The disturbances of bureaucracy seldom affect the crypto world as opposed to its corporate counterparts. The world of crypto offers no space for regulation, crypto-workers-unions, constructed hierarchies of power, or political faction. __ Yet these alternative assets are far from perfect and the precision of their technological developments has not always been surgical. The crypto space still faces serious questions regarding security and infrastructure. Given this, our interaction with the crypto world requires great responsibility to guide it through its nuanced beginnings. __  __ What is my place in all of this? Being situated at the convergence of two opposing eras, I have chosen to acknowledge the old but invite the new. It could very well be that these both worlds are not so diametrically opposed and that their coexistence is preferable to an adapting society. __ As entrepreneurs and forward-thinking individuals, we should find ways of gauging our failures and meticulously implementing solutions. In the crypto world, it happens to be that the essence of its unknown lays in the discovery of its value. __ What are your thoughts on the nascent crypto world?

Across South Africa criminals are hacking into computers so they can use them to mine cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It's known as cryptojacking and it is taking off in South Africa. Over the past couple of weeks experts have noticed a marked rise in the crime as cyber prospectors try to cash in on the bitcoin craze. __ Jacques van Heerden, chief executive of Global Technology Security Provider, says he knows of at least three companies that have been hit by cryptojacking locally. Banks have been targeted, too. __ “It’s happening in banks as their computers have a lot of processing power,” says Van Heerden. “The more processing power you can get, the quicker you can make money.” __ Read: Probe into Bitcoin Ponzi scheme __  The cashless society looms __ Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are mined by a complicated process that involves transactions that are verified and then added to the public ledger, which is known as the block chain. Cyptocurrency mining is a process of compiling transactions into blocks and then trying to solve a puzzle. The rewards are newly released cyber currency. But to solve this puzzle requires using a large amount of computing power. __ And cryptojackers are getting round this by hacking into and then harnessing the power of large groups of computers. __ They do this, Van Heerden says, by planting a mining app on the PC. “That mining app will then run on the local PC that got compromised, and it will send all the cryptocurrency that it mined to an anonymous bitcoin wallet.” __ Cyber investigators have also noted that IT personnel are using their own company computers to mine bitcoin. __ “The CEO doesn’t necessarily know, even in smaller companies, what the IT guys are doing,” says Cyanre CEO Danny Myburgh. Recently Myburgh’s company was called in to investigate what they initially thought was malware that had been installed on a computer. They later discovered that it was an IT staff member who was using the network to mine bitcoins. __ At first glance, cryptojacking might not appear to be a crime; after all the computer is being borrowed to make money. Often data isn't stolen and the computer isn't damaged. However, Myburgh says cyptojackers are breaking the law because they are hacking into a PC they don’t own and are using the data. __ There are other dangers too. “It makes these computers susceptible to an external attack because if anyone scans the network and sees there is bitcoin mining going on, that could paint a target on an organisation,” says Myburgh. __ Van Heerden says what is also concerning is that some cryptojackers are using tools that disable sophisticated antivirus software. “We were quite amazed at the technique they used and how easy it is,” he says. __ Police officials are aware of cryptojacking. __ Van Heerden says that one way of finding out if a computer is being covertly used to mine cybercurrencies is to see if the central processing unit is over-working. __ “In a normal computer it should be working at between 10 and 40%. Where there is mining it will be running at 70% and above.” __ Cryptojacking is still a new phenomenon in South Africa, but both Van Heerden and Myburgh believe it will continue to grow as more and more people see it as an easy way to make quick money. __ Saturday Star __ VIDEO: Gruesome mall assault filmed at Gateway __ Probe launched after Emirates flight attendant jumps out of plane __ Shock as DStv ditches Glow soapie channel __ Rand slides as investors purchase dollars __ Vodacom has increased their data prices __ Sign up to receive breaking news in your inbox. __ OR subscribe to e-editions of our Newspaper titles."
