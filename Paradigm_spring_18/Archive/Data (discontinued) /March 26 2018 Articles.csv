          The stubbornly high cost of remittances      	
Stephen Cecchetti, Kim  Schoenholtz 27 March 2018 
	Despite recent technological advances, the costs for migrants to send money across borders to their families remain extremely expensive, with fees often surpassing 5%. This column explores the various factors shaping remittance prices and identifies two key avenues for cost reduction: consumer education and competition. In particular, expanding mobile technology is helping to displace banks and squeeze remittance costs.	a	A	""With the implementation of ‘know your client’ rules, anti-money laundering efforts, and so on, it has become increasingly difficult to have an efficient payments system. Many banks have retired from the business, for example, of handling remittances, which are a very important source of income for many emerging markets.”Guillermo Ortiz, 19 March 2015.1	When migrants send money across borders to their families, it promotes economic activity and supports incomes in some of the poorest countries of the world. Annual cross-border remittances are running about $600 billion, three quarters of which flow to low- and middle-income countries. To put that number into perspective, total development assistance worldwide is $150 billion.2 Indeed, for many countries, these transfers account for a significant fraction of people’s incomes. For example, in Guatemala, the Philippines, and Senegal, remittances exceed 10% of GDP.	Yet, despite the remarkable technological advances of recent decades, remittances remain extremely expensive. The virtues of domestic payments systems like Zelle, an inexpensive, bank-run means for person-to-person transfers up to several thousand dollars, are very clear (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017b). The marginal cost of using Zelle is zero – that is, for customers of the bank, there is no charge.	Cross-border remittances are far from costless. On average, the charge for sending $200 – the benchmark used by authorities to evaluate cost – is $14. That is, the combination of fees (including charges from both the sender and recipient intermediaries) and the exchange rate margin typically eats up fully 7% of the amount sent. It is less expensive to send larger amounts, with the global average cost of sending $500 at just under 5% (World Bank 2017b). Even so, the aggregate cost of sending remittances in 2017 was about $30 billion, roughly equivalent to the total non-military foreign aid budget of the US!	In this column, we discuss remittances, why their costs remain high, and what might be done to lower them.	We start with a quick look at some data. Figure 1 below shows that the inflation-adjusted volume of remittances exploded over the past two decades. Today, these flows are triple what they were in 2000 and five times what they were in 1990. Furthermore, the economic importance of inward remittances has increased for low- and middle-income countries, rising from an average of 1.2% of GDP in 1990 to 1.6% of GDP today.	Figure 1 Aggregate volume of remittances, 1970-2017 (billions of 2017 US$)		Note: Inflation-adjusted sum of country-specific remittance flows. Source: World Bank.	You might think that this massive increase in volume either reflects, or promotes, cost-reducing advances in remittance technology. But, as the next figure shows, costs have trended lower only gradually, and with considerable differences across types of transfer agents and across sender countries. The red line is the simple, unweighted average for all providers – banks, money transfer operators (MTOs, including fintech companies) and post offices – of sending $200 from the full World Bank sample of 48 sending countries. Over the past decade, this global average has fallen from 9.8% to 7.1%. However, in the case of MTOs (the dashed, black line), like Western Union, the cost has stagnated in recent years. After falling by 2.5 percentage points before 2014, the average charge remains around 8%. And, in the US (the blue line), the cost has declined only very modestly, falling from just over 7% in 2009 to roughly 6%, where it has stayed for three years.	Importantly, remittances are a very profitable business for large operators. Western Union, for example, completed 268 million customer-to-customer transfers in 2016, with a value of $80 billion. Total revenue for the year exceeded $5 billion, with net profits surpassing $250 million.3	Figure 2 Average cost of sending $200 across a border, 2008-17 (% of total)		Note: The red and black lines show the evolution of the average cost of sending funds from any one of 48 sending countries to any of 105 receiving countries in the sample. The data include a total of 365 pairs (or corridors). The blue line shows the cost of sending from the US. Source: World Bank.	Drilling down to the corridor level (that is, to specific country pairs), remittance costs vary considerably, but still strike us as high in most instances. Take the benchmark case of sending $200 or the equivalent. The average cost of a transfer from the US to Mexico is $8.91; from Germany to Turkey, it is $12.83; and from South Africa to Botswana, the average is a whopping $36.60.	Even within a specific corridor, the cost varies substantially. For example, someone wishing to send $200 from Italy to Morocco would pay anywhere from $1.93, if they were able to use the internet service provided by Transferwise, to $14 if they went to Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a commercial bank. Using a Western Union agent for that same transfer would cost $10.17. While the speed of the transfer varies somewhat, the vast majority of services provide funds the next day or sooner.4	As mentioned, the aggregate global cost of these transfers is now roughly $30 billion per year. While the direct cost is borne by the migrant senders and their family recipients, there is a sense in which the burden also falls on poor countries as a whole. The reason is that remittances enhance growth in poor countries by providing alternative means for financing investment where transactions costs are high (Giuliano and Ruiz-Arranz 2009). That is, we can think of policies that make remittances easier and cheaper as a means of boosting capital formation and productivity in receiving countries.	Against this background, in July 2009 the leaders of the largest advanced economies (G8) pledged to reduce the cost of remittances to 5% – a commitment endorsed by the G20 in 2011 and again in 2014, and included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in 2015 (G8 2009, G20 2011, United Nations 2015). After eight years, the global average is roughly half-way there. What can be done to lower remittance costs further?	There are two major mechanisms for reducing costs: education and competition. On the first, what if customers became sufficiently well informed that they only use the cheapest available services?  To answer this question, the World Bank has computed what they call the Smart Remitter Target (SmaRT). This competitive benchmark is the average of the three lowest-cost remittance service providers in each corridor. At the end of 2017, the global SmaRT average was 5.17%. This means that a process of education alone might be sufficient to reduce the average cost by as much as 2 percentage points.5	Turning to competition, Beck and Martínez Pería (2009) conclude that corridors with more migrants and more competition exhibit lower costs. Importantly, over one-half of all remittances are paid to persons in just ten countries (see below). However, where banks’ share in the business is high, costs are high as well. In fact, in the December 2017 issue of Remittance Prices Worldwide, the World Bank reports that remittance costs vary substantially by the instrument used, with transfers using cash and bank accounts costing 7%, much more than the 4.2% average cost of using mobile money (World bank 2017a). It appears that expanding mobile technology (and displacing banks) will help squeeze remittance costs.	Figure 3 Top 10 countries for inward remittances, 2017 (billions of $)		Source: World Bank.	But, as Guillermo Ortiz suggests in the quote at the top of this column, a key challenge looms. Most forms of cross-border funds transfer require the cooperation of a bank at some point in the process. An MTO, for example, needs accounts at banks on both ends of the transfer corridor. However, in response to stronger anti-money-laundering standards, banks have been terminating or restricting their relationships with MTOs (KNOMAD 2017).	From the perspective of a bank, mobile payments create similar risks. As is the case for virtual currencies like Bitcoin, mobile payments systems can be used to conceal nefarious activities (Cecchetti and Schoenholtz 2017a). Meeting the ‘know your customer’ standards that banks demand (and governments expect) is expensive. As a result, these factors may continue to throttle the speed with which cost-competitive technology firms make inroads into the remittance business.	That said, the goal of reducing the cost of small remittances to 5% is clearly within reach. And, efforts to streamline the know your customer and anti-money laundering processes (including through the use of legal entity identifiers) could get us there (and beyond) faster.6	Editors’ note: An earlier version of this column appeared on www.moneyandbanking.com.

1,Reuters,"Sign up now to get free exclusive access to reports, research and invitation only events.	Following Google and Facebook as online crackdown widens	Twitter Inc will start banning cryptocurrency advertising from Tuesday, joining Facebook and Google in a clampdown that seeks to avoid giving publicity to potential fraud or large investor losses.	The prohibition will cover advertising of initial coin offerings (ICOs) – crowdfunding used to raise cash by creating new coins – as well as token sales, the San Francisco-based firm told Reuters on Monday.	The new policy, which will be rolled out over the next 30 days, will also ban ads by cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency wallet services, unless they are public companies listed on certain major stock markets.	For Japan, these will be limited to crypto exchanges regulated by its national financial regulator, Twitter said.	The firm had said this month it was taking measures to prevent crypto-related accounts from ""engaging with others in a deceptive manner"", but faced calls to go further after bans from Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.	Facebook has restricted crypto-related adverts, while Google announced a ban that comes into force in June.	The price of bitcoin, already 4 percent in the red on Monday, fell further after the Twitter announcement. It traded at $7,920 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange at 1740 GMT, down more than six per cent on the day.	Regulators' warnings	Regulators have stepped up warnings that bitcoin and other virtual currencies are highly speculative and that some could be fraudulent, and that investors should be prepared to lose everything.	But last week the G20 group of rich nations failed to reach a consensus on how to supervise them.	Adverts for virtual coins or ways to trade them have appeared everywhere from London's transport network to Japanese television as demand for them has soared.	""With the increasing number of ICOs coming to market, it is an impossible task for anyone, much less platforms likeTwitter or Facebook, to keep on top of which ICOs and cryptocurrencies are genuine versus frauds,"" said Zennon Kapron, director of the financial consultancy Kapronasia.	""Although certainly ICO advertising must have been a significant source of revenue for Twitter, the repercussions of fraudulent activities just weren't worth the risk.""	Bitcoin has lost more than half its value from a December peak of almost $20,000 as fears of a regulatory clampdown spooked investors. News of the Facebook and Google bans also knocked the price.	Ethereum and Ripple's XRP, the second- and third-biggest digital currencies by market capitalisation, have tumbled this year too.	While critics call cryptocurrencies a Ponzi scheme that will end in tears for most investors, supporters say the coins are backed by powerful new technology that can replace traditional fiat currencies and upend the existing banking system.

Find out how retail foreign exchange traders are looking at the New Zealand Dollar right now on the DailyFX Sentiment Page
	
The New Zealand Dollar didn’t get much of a lift from news of a surprise trade surplus in its homeland Monday, possibly because its central bank announced a change to its mandate which could keep interest rates lower for longer.
	
February’s overall surplus came in at NZ$217 million (US$153 million), against expectations of a NZ$ 100 million trade deficit. Within that both imports and exports rose by less than expected however, with the import miss perhaps likely to raise some questions about the underlying strength of the New Zealand economy despite some positive indications elsewhere.
	
Still, these latest figures do represent a bounce back from January’s deep deficit and it is perhaps surprising that the New Zealand Dollar failed to gain more strongly on them.
	
One reason might emanate from the direction of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Monday is the day when new Governor Adrian Orr takes over as Governor. His appointment was announced in December. However, the RBNZ also said on Monday that it had accepted a new dual monetary policy mandate.
	
Whereas before price stability was the RBNZ’s primary goal, it will now have to officially consider maximum, sustainable employment as a policy outcome too. This possibility was well known to the markets as New Zealand’s new government had made no secret of its intention to change the mandate since its election last year.
	
The most likely outcome of the change is probably that the RBNZ will now err on the side of keeping rates lower than it might have done in the days when it had a single policy target. With interest rates already at record lows, and inflation torpid, the mandate’s introduction may see the kiwi struggle, although markets have had some time to get used to it.
	
Indeed, this prospect is probably part of the reason behind NZD/USD’s gradual 2018 decline on its daily chart, which remains the dominant feature of trading.
	
At present the pair remains in the middle of the band formed by that downtrend channel, and is currently finding support at the highs of early January.

	The majority of ICOs are scams, but it's still a booming business, said CoinList CEO and Co-Founder Andy Bromberg. 	""The hit rate is very low in this industry,"" Bromberg told CNBC, regarding ICOs, or initial coin offerings, a crowdfunding way to raise funds for cryptocurrency ventures.	""CoinList has publicly had on our site only three ICOs out of more than 900 in-bound applications,"" he said on ""Fast Money"" Monday. His company, CoinList, is an online platform that guides token creators through the IPO process while helping investors determine which IPOs are legitimate. 	ICOs, a still-unregulated means of raising money in its ""modern form,"" Bromberg said, have been around for less than a year and thus are an attractive way for start-ups to raise capital while bypassing regulations. As the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin took off in 2017, ICOs became increasingly popular.	But even as major cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have plunged, ICOs continue to gain speed. Already, ICOs have raised about $3 billion in funds this year — and the first quarter isn't even over yet. That's almost half of what ICOs raised last year. Still, Bromberg said, roughly half of all ICOs in 2017 failed. 	""They're incredibly risky early stage investments,""  said Bromberg, whose company manages nearly a billion dollars in crypto investments.  	Meanwhile, bitcoin and other cryptos are falling fast. Bitcoin, the largest digital coin by market cap, fell below $8,000 again, down 40 percent this year. Ethereum is down 33 percent year to date and Ripple is down 70 percent. 	Scrutiny from regulators, such as the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission, over ICOs is increasing, something Bromberg called ""reasonable."" He also said it was wise for internet companies, such as Google and Twitter, to ban cryptocurrency ads on their platforms. 	""Evaluating these sales is really hard,"" he said. ""It requires a great deal of expertise. That's expertise that very few people have because the ICO industry is so new.""	While Bromberg said, ""regulation is coming,"" for ICOs, he also said there are things investors can do now to determine if an ICO is worth putting their money into. This includes evaluating the integrity of the company, the technical team and what products the company has built in the past.  	""At the beginning, you have to do the same team evaluation for any startup or any company you're investing in,"" he said. ""And that's really what helps you determine if the sale will help you finance a company that builds something meaningful, or if they're just raising money for the sake of raising money and going to run away with it.""","One expert said the majority of initial coin offerings, or ICOs, are scams — but it's still a booming business.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/26/how-to-evaluate-risky-initial-coin-offerings-and-avoid-scams.html,2018-03-26 23:18:00+00:00,How to evaluate risky initial coin offerings and avoid scams
5,"Amanda Lee, Josh Ye, Amanda Lee, Josh Ye","	Blockchain	‘Where there’s demand, there will be supply … If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks,’ says vice-president of the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, of the enduring appeal of cryptocurrency offerings 	Comments:  		Initial coin offerings (ICOs) may well have been banned in China since September last year – but the opportunity of getting involved in these virtual fund-raisings, using “cryptocurrencies”, has far from disappeared altogether.	ICOs are a form of crowdsourced by which companies exchange their newly created online currencies, called “tokens”, for hard currency. 	Before the ban, ICOs were marketed across China using online platforms. But all those sites were closed nationally by The People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the country’s central bank, with operators ordered to return money to investors. 	The PBOC has since claimed in a report that a staggering 90 per cent of the ICOs launched in the country were fraudulent. 	Its biggest fear was social unrest arising from an ICO proving to be nothing more than a fraudulent way of raising cash from unsuspecting investors.	Bitcoin latest: prices, policies and politics	China’s monetary authorities were also acutely aware of virtual currencies and coin offers being used by corrupt officials to transfer money out of the country. 	The result was a blanket ban on online virtual currency exchanges offering trading services for domestic investors on transactions denominated in yuan.	But even with that ban in place, online agencies are still advising customers on how to get involved in ICOs, and funnelling interested parties in their direction, via overseas websites.	Instead of offerings marketed directly online, ICOs are often promoted on Tencent Holdings’ social messaging service WeChat through such agents or middlemen, who are charging hefty fees for the privilege.		One agent called An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain charges up to 10 per cent commission for each offering and according to a list its customers have been sent on WeChat, there are currently eight ICOs available. These include names such as RightMesh, Dfinity, and Wireline, the last of which is presented on a dedicated Chinese-language site. Where they are eventually listing and their values remain unknown.	Canada-based RightMesh claims to be the first platform to offer investments in mobile mesh networks – communications networks using radio nodes – using blockchain technology. 	Dfinity is building a new kind of public decentralised cloud computing resource, while Wireline is planning to operate a micro-services exchange for developers. 	“RightMesh is not seeking investment in China and has no affiliation with Tian Ce,” a spokesperson representing the Canadian company, said in an emailed statement.		An Hui Tian Ce Blockchain’s customer service representative told South China Morning Post that the charge is required upfront, depending on the amount being bought, and must be paid in ethereum – a token popular among ICO organisers that is similar to bitcoin, arguably the world’s best-known virtual currency.	There is no official data on how many are operating or how much has been raised on WeChat or other social media platforms in China. 	Beijing bans bitcoin, but when did it all go wrong for cryptocurrencies in China?	But commentators suggested the original risks which prompted the Chinese authorities to outlaw them in the first place still exist – effectively, that these agents could run away after the fees are paid, as could their investments.	CNBC reported last year, for instance, that a start-up ICO for a company called Confido deleted its site and social media accounts soon after raising US$375,000. 	While direct sales online are not permitted, Dragonsocial – a Hong Kong-based marketing agency which helps foreign ICO companies reach Chinese investors – has also been actively building what it calls “cryptocurrency communities” on WeChat.		“Lots of companies launched ICOs last year, when there were a limited number of investors. 	“We thought it was high time to provide them with a service,” said Cao Ming Xiu, Dragonsocial’s operations officer in mainland China.	China wants to be a front runner in blockchain technology even if the ban on bitcoin remains	“There were many cases in China where people posted adverts with big WeChat groups. But that goes against Chinese regulations, and we don’t do that.	“Rather, what we do is community-building. We don’t promote our clients and their ICOs in groups, instead we discuss them.”	Cao said more than 20,000 such WeChat groups exist nationwide, focused on discussion rather actual ICO execution.	“Some groups have hundreds of people involved. A small percentage of them are our employees, and they lead conversations,” said Raymond Lam, Dragonsocial’s head of growth. “It is through that, we help members discuss certain new projects.”	The companies Dragonsocial represents, Lam said, are often involved in financial technology and logistics ICOs.	“Through discussion within these groups, there are now [more] people in the mainland capable and aware of reaching overseas websites or official ICO outlets, that allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies,” Cao said.	“The mainland has banned ICOs. So cryptocurrency investors now have to access overseas trading platforms to exchange theirs [cryptos] for US dollars or Hong Kong dollars.”	Why has China declared war on bitcoin and digital currencies?	Emil Chan, vice-president at the Hong Kong Blockchain Society, believes it is hard to effectively regulate the dealers, without an official licensing mechanism in place. 	But with the number of tokens issued last year globally rising a hundred-fold, he said speculators are sure to continue jumping on the bandwagon, regardless of the fears that undoubtedly still exist.	According to ICO tracking firm Token Data, of the 902 token sales launched last year, 46 per cent failed to materialise.	“But where there’s demand, there will be supply,” said Chan. “If there are gains to be made, then people will take risks.” 	He said a more meaningful way of tackling illegal ICO sales is to issue licences, which is already happening in Japan. Cryptocurrency exchanges there, require a payment institution licence to operate.  	“There is actually no way to ban all unregulated dealers, he said. [If you ban one], they’ll just set up another,” Chan said. 	 	You are signed up.

While Bottoms told Channel 2 Action News Monday morning that the city is making more progress each day, the situation is not yet resolved.	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack. This really is an attack on our government, which means this is an attack on all of us and we just want to continue to be thoughtful, and will continue to be thoughtful to make sure that as a city that we are doing all that we need to do to make sure that we are secure going forward,” Bottoms said.

7,Thomas Delahunty,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	Cyber-criminals attempting to con people out of their Bitcoin are getting more and more creative — but we’ve never seen anything like this: a would-be victim has convinced a Bitcoin scammer to paint his face like a raccoon and rifle through his neighbor’s trash can. The pictures of their interaction and resulting photos have since gone viral as the prankster somehow got the Egyptian conman to comply with strange demands.	As reported by the Irish Mirror, Belfast man Neil Murphy, 34, was sent a friend request on Facebook with messages inquiring about Bitcoin. Murphy’s suspicions were immediately aroused that it could be a scam, but he decided to have some fun.  	Instead of telling Yousef, who said he was from Egypt, to leave him alone, he agreed to send him 0.15 Bitcoin if Yousef dressed up as a raccoon and foraged through his neighbor’s trash cans. When Yousef asked for $100 worth of Bitcoin in a bid to secure the deal, Murphy said: 	“I cannot trust you. I have been scammed before. “Last time I sent somebody the Bitcoin and he sent me a picture of him dressed as a badger instead of a racoon and he didn’t even scavenge in a bin.”	Yosef, somehow obliged, saying: “I’ll wear the raccoons and send you a picture.”	“I also love raccoons very much and we have a farm that has a lot of them.” 	He then told Murphy that it would take him at least two days to source the outfit and take the pictures. Murphy replied: “Ok maybe you don’t even need to buy a costume you could just put some white stripes on your face and you will look like an natural raccoon.”	For the final set of photos, Murphy made some more demands. He asked Yousef to wear a black and white striped top — for a more realistic raccoon look — and said he wanted there to be more trash in the photo and for it to be taken at night.	The desperate scammer complied and sent more photos of himself in the striped top, this time scavenging in a huge over-turned trash can. Murphy, then, decided to end things and told Yousef he would not be receiving any money. In response the scammer blocked him. 	The full conversation can be found here.	fake story got to do better than this/	Yeah, not buying it either.	send ME .15 BTC and I’ll let you watch me paint my toes live via webcam.

8,Scott Scanlon,"Nongaming venues inside Las Vegas casinos such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets are moving quicker to capture a young, generally wealthy, niche clientele. Strip casinos might never accept cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin on the gaming floor because of the state’s industry regulations.	 But nongaming venues inside those establishments, such as high-end clubs, restaurants and retail outlets, are working to capture the young, generally wealthy niche clients who use cryptocurrencies. The effort is being supported by people traveling to Las Vegas for technology and finance conferences that touch on cryptocurrencies, such as CES and Money20/20.	 And at least seven conferences in Las Vegas this year are dedicated to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, the backbone of the new digital money. The Elena Bulatova Gallery in The Shops at Crystals on the Strip began accepting cryptocurrencies this year after receiving about 20 inquires, said gallery manager Vince Notardonato.	 Bulatova, who has four galleries in the western United States, made her first sale with bitcoin at her Palm Springs location in mid-March. Bulatova, who was pursing a doctorate in economics before launching her art career, said she has a personal interest in cryptocurrencies.	 Her experience has shown her that acceptance in Las Vegas venues will be a function not only of customer demand but also of management understanding and enthusiasm. ”I thought accepting cryptocurrencies would increase the buying pool of people. If someone bought cryptocurrencies a few years ago, they can afford to buy a lot of things now, like artwork,” she said.

Bitcoin dropped below US$8,000 ($10,964) to US$7,863, according to Coindesk.	 Twitter Inc. confirmed Monday that it's banning advertisements for initial coin offerings and token sales on its social-media platform. The decision comes after Facebook Inc. banned cryptocurrency ads in January and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it would ban such ads starting in June, as part of a broader effort to crack down on deceptive and misleading advertising on their platforms.	 After reaching a record high of almost US$20,000 in December, Bitcoin has slumped about 60 per cent as investors reconsider the prospects of the digital currency and regulators around the world increase scrutiny.	 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sent a number of subpoenas earlier this month to ICO teams it suspects are breaking securities regulations, and it has warned since July that some of the offerings may be breaking securities regulations.

11,Reuters Editorial,"2 Min Read	(Reuters) - Atlanta is still struggling with its ability to collect online payments of bills and fees, officials said on Monday, four days after a ransomware attack snarled the computer system of Georgia’s capital city. 	Hackers caused outages of services offered through the city’s website and broader computer system while demanding a ransom of $51,000 paid in bitcoin to unlock the system.  	“This is much bigger than a ransomware attack, this really is an attack on our government,” Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told a news conference. “We are dealing with a (cyber) hostage situation.” 	She did not say whether Atlanta would pay the ransom. Atlanta officials said they have determined the hackers’ identity but declined to elaborate. City representatives were not immediately available for further comment. 	Bottoms said only that the hackers entered the city’s digital system remotely as opposed having had internal access. 	Ransomware is a type of malware that infects computers or computer networks and then freezes them, with the attackers demanding a ransom in order to restore services. The initial assault often comes via a phishing link that someone within the network opens on their email.  	As the disruption in Atlanta persists, the city is losing out financially, Bottoms told an earlier news conference on Friday. It was unclear how much it stands to lose or when the city expects to get its computer system fully operational again.

Though, as Cointelegraph first reported, it looks like the decision was based on cryptocurrency exchange Coindesk changing its terms of its merchant service Coindesk Commerce. 	To confirm this is the case we reached out to Reddit,  who referred back to a Reddit admin's comments about the Coindesk changes and the slim chance that the cryptocurrency will return to the site.	The admin wrote over the weekend, ""The upcoming Coinbase change, combined with some bugs around the Bitcoin payment option that were affecting purchases for certain users, led us to remove Bitcoin as a payment option.""	So long, bitcoin.	","Reddit Gold is done with bitcoin. The premium version of the online forum Reddit used to let you pay for an upgraded membership with the cryptocurrency, bitcoin.

        	Super model!!!
I have compared this model to others and to pictures of the original prop and this seems to be the most accurate by far.
Any change to create a version of the handle with a battery compartment and some kind of path for optical fiber/wiring? (For That red led when the pistol is engaged).
Many thanks in advance.

15,Cointelegraph By Rakesh Upadhyay,"Cointelegraph	Technical analysis on top 9 cryptocurrencies.	Price Analysis	The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.	During a bear market, fear grips the investors, resulting in a long liquidation. While some believe that the bubble in Bitcoin has burst, others believe that the current fall is only a correction, which will lead to higher prices later in the year.	Founder and chairman of investment firm LDJ Capital, David Drake believes that Bitcoin will rally to $30,000 by the year-end. That is a whopping 262 percent return from the current levels.	Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, believes that Bitcoin can replace the fiat currencies within a decade.	A few positive voices in a sea of gloom is a welcome change. Let’s see if the short-term picture is improving or not.	Though Bitcoin broke out of the descending channel on March 20, it could not cross above the 20-day EMA. Currently, prices are again threatening to dip back into the channel, which is a bearish development. Our long positions initiated at $8,800 are trading under a loss. As the setup looks negative, we suggest booking a loss on 50 percent of the open positions and holding the rest with the stops at $7,600.		The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $7,715, below which, a retest of the February 06 lows of $6,075.04 is possible.	Our bearish view on the BTC/USD pair will be invalidated if prices breakout and sustain above the 50-day SMA.	Ethereum is in a strong downtrend. It continues to trade inside the channel and below both the moving averages, which are falling sharply. The recovery attempt by the bulls failed at the $590 levels.  		The final critical support on the downside is the March 18 lows of $452.32. Below this level, the ETH/USD pair can fall to $385.	The RSI is deeply oversold, which shows that the selling has been overdone. We anticipate another pullback attempt within the next few days. The first sign of strength will be when the bulls sustain above $600. Until then, the bears will continue to sell on rallies.	Bitcoin Cash has broken below the $1,000 levels after holding it for three days. The next support on the downside is the March 18 lows $884.7951.		If the BCH/USD pair breaks below this, it will retest the February 06 lows of $778.2021. Bears have the upper hand as they have not allowed the price to climb above the 20-day EMA since February 21.	We should turn positive only after the cryptocurrency breaks out of the 50-day SMA.       	Our anticipation of a range bound trading action on Ripple is proving to be wrong. Prices are falling sharply towards the lower end of the range at $0.56270. Our suggested long position at $0.71, on March 19 is deeply in the red. Our stop loss is at $0.52, just below the March 18 lows.		If the XRP/USD pair breaks below $0.5375, a fall to $0.22 is possible, because there is no support in between.	The cryptocurrency will become positive only above $0.72.	Stellar did not close above our buy trigger of $0.25, as recommended in the previous analysis. Therefore, we don’t have any position in it.		The XLM/USD pair is gradually falling towards the $0.2 levels, which is a critical support. If this support breaks, the cryptocurrency can slide to the support line of the descending channel at $0.1 levels.	We’d better wait for prices to turn up before suggesting any long positions in it.	Our long position in Litecoin recommended at $165 is under loss. Traders who have initiated long positions should keep the stop loss at $142.		The LTC/USD pair has again fallen below the downtrend line, which is a bearish sign. A critical support is the March 18 lows of $144.544. If this level breaks, the support line of the symmetrical triangle can provide support at $127, below which a retest of the February 02 lows of $107.102 will be on the cards.	The virtual currency will turn bullish only after it breaks out of the $200 levels.	Though Cardano broke out of the downtrend line on March 21, it could not break out of the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance at 0.00002460. Our buy levels of 0.000025 have not triggered and stand canceled.		The ADA/BTC pair will spend a few days in the range of 0.00001690 and 0.00002460. A breakdown below the supports will prove to be bearish while a breakout will carry prices higher. Therefore, we need to wait for a breakout and close above the overhead resistance before initiating any trade.	NEO has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakdown and close below $65.		After the initial bounce from the lows of $49.04 on March 18, we had expected the bulls to strongly defend the $65 levels during the pullback. However, after failing to rise above $70 for the past three days, prices have now broken down of the support levels.	Next, if $49.04 level breaks, the NEO/USD pair can slide to $31.15 levels. Our bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls quickly reverse and sustain prices above $65.   	We wanted to buy EOS once it broke out of the descending channel but that did not happen. After staying above the 20-day EMA for the past five days, prices have slipped this week.		The EOS/USD pair has some support at the $5.84 mark. Below that, it can slide to $5 levels.	On the upside, even if the bulls manage to push prices above the 20-day EMA, they will again face a stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA.	The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

		NEW YORK (AP) - Twitter says it will ban or restrict advertisements related to cryptocurrencies in an attempt to crack down on fraud. The move follows similar steps by Facebook and Google earlier this year.	Twitter said the new rules will roll out starting Tuesday and will apply to all advertisers in about a month. The new policy prohibits ads for initial coin offerings, in which a startup issues a currency that can be used to buy services with the company.	Ads for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services, meanwhile, will be restricted and limited to those that are provided by a public company under Twitter's new policy.	The price of a bitcoin dropped below $8,000 on Monday.	Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

19,Colin Harper,"Ready to start building Dapps? Dive deep into blockchain development. Subscribe Now	Staff Writer	One of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency vendors, Coinbase Inc., is planning on adding Ethereum-based tokens to its milieu of crypto assets.	The company made its plans public in a blog post today, March 26, 2018, indicating that it will integrate the ERC20 technical standards into all of its platforms.	“We’re excited to announce our intention to support the Ethereum ERC20 technical standard for Coinbase in the coming months. This paves the way for supporting ERC20 assets across Coinbase products in the future,” the blog post reads.	The post continues to say that the company will not disclose “support for any specific assets or features at this time,” stressing that the announcement complies with company guidelines for new asset listings. This process involves a legal and risk assessment by an asset selection committee; review and approval by the Coinbase executive team; a public announcement of the new listing prior to integration; and a technical implementation of the asset followed by another public announcement of the complete integration.	Coinbase released this formal approval and integration process after coming under fire for insider trading when it abruptly listed Bitcoin Cash on December 19, 2017. Since this headache, Coinbase has actively hushed any hearsay for new listings, such as its recent denial of rumors involving an integration of Ripple.	Treading carefully into uncharted territory, the team “will wait for additional regulatory clarity before [they] decide which ERC20 assets to support.” When the air is cleared, the elect ERC20 tokens will first come to GDAX, Coinbase’s centralized exchange extension. Only once an asset is listed on GDAX and the Coinbase team evaluates factors “such as liquidity, price stability and other market health metrics” will they consider adding it to Coinbase, according to the post. Additionally, any asset added to GDAX will automatically be weighted into The Coinbase Index Fund.	Besides offering a wider asset offering to its customer base, Coinbase “believes that support for ERC20 will also give [it] a path to enabling the safe recovery [of] customer ERC20 assets inadvertently sent to Coinbase Ethereum addresses.”	Toshi, an Ethereum wallet and dApp browser owned by Coinbase, added support for ERC20 tokens and ERC721 assets in late February of this year. A February 28 blog post reveals the specifications of this development. Unlike their close kin, the ERC20 token, ERC721 assets (or collectibles, as the post calls them) are unique, non-fungible assets.	These collectibles carry individual properties that are specific to each ERC721 token, and their value is independent of any other asset registered under the same token address. CryptoKitties are a prime example, where one CryptoKitty may be worth 0.3 ETH while another may be worth 5 ETH.	At the time of this article, Coinbase has not offered any information to suggest that it will offer support for ERC721 assets on any of its other platforms.	Thank you!

20,Guest Post,"The Japanese government has made major strides towards the acceptance of cryptocurrency. Japan is among the countries that recognize Bitcoin legal tender with over 30% of world Bitcon dealings being conducted in Yen. With this kind of positive outlook, Japan is poised to become a cryptocurrency capital in Asia, and even the world over.	Despite the positive reception and support that cryptocurrencies enjoy from the Japanese government, the country still struggles with regulating the market. The recent hacking and loss of $534 million in Coincheck, has led to a crackdown of cryptocurrency exchanges by the country’s regulator, Financial Services Authority (FSA).	Inefficient Systems	According to the FSA, some of the exchanges in Japan do not have effective systems in  place to monitor trading. Employees do not have requisite training for operation, and the exchanges also lack proper cybersecurity frameworks.	These problems are not peculiar to the Japanese market alone, they are rampant in other countries as well. In the US, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has released a warning about virtual currency exchanges, saying that many of them are not regulated and can do anything they wish with investor money.	To this effect, the Japan Financial Services Agency has handed a one month suspension to two exchanges, FSHO (Yokohama City) and BitStation (Nagoya Prefecture). Five other exchanges have received business improvement orders.	This is not the first time Japan has attempted to regulate the cryptocurrency market. In April 2017, the government required exchanges to register and obtain trading licenses from FSA. This is the same thing being currently implemented by the SEC in the US, and other governments are expected to join for purposes of protecting investors in the cryptomarket.	The crackdown on virtual exchanges has been felt in India where two exchanges have closed shop citing harsh government stance. Industry players view these latest regulatory measures by governments as short term and it will take time for comprehensive standards to be developed. For standards to be effective, there will be a need for input and cooperation from market players.	Tom Meredith, CEO of BitMinutes, says,“Regulators can only do so much. Standards take months, if not years, to set. The criminals are often are, way ahead of the ability of standard setters to keep up, which is not a new issue. It is on us to keep risk management at the top of our priority list to protect our customer data, and their purchases, safe. I know my Chief Technology Officer loses at least an hour of sleep every night over the possible threats he needs to anticipate.”	Boosting Confidence	Though governments are trying to regulate cryptocurrency exchanges and take control of  the market, Roman Demidov, CEO of Firelotto, feels that this could add restrictions for ICOs.	“Governments are trying to regulate cryptocurrency exchange and take a control over the market. This will lead to many restrictions for new ICOs and their tokens to be listed on exchanges. We hope that the initial idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies – board less, fast, anonymous transactions without government involvement will stay unchanged,” Demidov says.	However, despite the fact that crackdowns on crypto exchanges seem unfriendly, they  should be viewed as strong signs that governments are building an environment where investors feel safe entrusting their virtual currencies to crypto exchanges.	The crackdown on virtual exchanges will help restore sanity in the cryptomarket. Investors will have confidence trading in exchanges that are registered and approved by government agencies. According to Eugene Liebermann, CEO of the CAR token company, exchanges will have to comply with set government regulations to sustain operations.	He says, “Crypto exchanges have no choice but obey, and many more countries will find it profitable to regulate this market.”	By David Drake	Disclaimer: David Drake is on the advisory board for most of the firms mentioned or quoted in this article.

Coinbase has announced its intention to support the Ethereum ERC20 technical standard — meaning more cryptocurrencies will likely be added to the popular exchange in the coming months.	In a post on the company’s official blog, Coinbase has announced its plans to support the Ethereum ERC20 technical standard.	ERC20 — which stands for Ethereum Request for Comment 20 — is the Ethereum token standard and is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. As noted by Coinbase:	ERC20 assets have become a popular way for teams to quickly build interoperable contracts/assets.	The update, which will roll out in the coming months, will allow for the support of ERC20 assets across Coinbase products.	We’re excited to announce our intention to support the Ethereum ERC20 technical standard for Coinbase in the coming months.	We are not announcing support for any specific assets today.https://t.co/glAjG42tZD pic.twitter.com/S1tPXJcTGH	— Coinbase (@coinbase) March 26, 2018		However, the popular cryptocurrency exchange has not announced support for any specific assets or features. Notes Coinbase:	We are announcing this both internally and to the public as consistent with our process for adding new assets.	This significant announcement comes roughly one month after the popular exchange rolled out support for SegWit transactions on the Bitcoin network – which has significantly reduced bitcoin transaction fees on the platform.	The announcement from Coinbase has implications for the company’s entire family of products.	In regards to GDAX  — Coinbase’s sister exchange — the company has noted that “the GDAX team will wait for additional regulatory clarity before [deciding] which ERC20 assets to support on GDAX.” However, ERC20 support will afford GDAX the ability to securely recover customer ERC20 assets accidentally sent to the exchange’s Ethereum addresses.		Though Coinbase will soon support ERC20 assets, the exchange will continue to follow company policy and only list additional assets after they are listed on GDAX. Said assets may only gain admission to the popular exchange after undergoing strict evaluations in regards to their “liquidity, price stability, and other market health metrics.”	However, the company notes that admission to the GDAX platform does not automatically mean an ERC20 token will be listed on Coinbase and that GDAX “will likely have more assets listed on the platform than the Coinbase platform.”	As is also the case with GDAX, ERC20 support on Coinbase also allows for the safe recovery of ERC20 assets accidentally sent to Coinbase Ethereum addresses.		Meanwhile, the Coinbase Custody team is considering various assets to support for deposits and withdrawals, and Coinbase Asset Management  will add any asset listed on GDAX to the Coinbase Index “on a market capitalization weighted basis.”	Are you excited to learn that Coinbase will soon support the Ethereum ERC20 technical standard?

22,Jeff Barrett,"If you're still trying to get your head around Bitcoin and ICOs, that's understandable. Blockchain though, the underlying social encryption technology behind cryptocurrency, is applicable to any and all industries.	The far-reaching implications of its technology are well documented. Blockchain's ascension to top buzzword of 2018 is based on its potential to bring transparency and efficiency, eradicate fraud, wipe out corruption, fix supply chain issues, and give people power over their data.	A blockchain can be applied to anything, immediately. It will be years before we are using a different form of payment for most goods.	When I view cryptocurrency for the immediate future I'm far more interested in the innovative uses of ICOs as alternatives to venture capital than if someone will eventually be able to use Dogecoin at their local supermarket. That's the real and applicable stuff for startups and entrepreneurs.	An ICO can be more substantial than a quick way to gain funding. Swytch, an upcoming ICO, is a renewable energy token. Built on a blockchain, it will use data and advanced modeling to estimate the relative environmental impact of user's energy use and allocate tokens accordingly.	Basically, they're creating a real monetary incentive for smart energy use. And they intend on a Proof-of-Production protocol that creates evidential proof of energy production to capture data directly from existing smart meters and create a network of trusted devices. 	Why do I mention this? Because you can't create a simple ICO anymore. Those days are gone. A random coin offering will not perform. Just like any movement or marketplace, there has to be a compelling reasoning behind an ICO in 2018.	Last year, it was new enough to just create one and succeed. Now, it's just like pitching anything: It has to have substance and a marketing hook that points towards stability in an unstable market.	The immediate and obvious answer is you may get more funding. The Long Island Iced Tea Company changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation and the dollars started pouring in.	But don't they still just sell an assortment of ready-to-drink beverages? They sure do. 	That oft-used example shows you how powerful the buzzword is this year. But beyond that, there are tangible reasons to use a blockchain. It's a public ledger that can store and manage all types of transactions. Transactions take place within ""blocks"" that are time stamped and linked to each other. Tampering with any information in a block would affect the entire chain, making it impossible to meddle with and more secure.	Facebook's recent struggles are proof that any company, no matter the size, is susceptible to eroding public trust if it can't keep user data secure. There's a reckoning coming. Established companies like Facebook will probably survive and be just fine. Startups looking to get funded might not.	In my experience, most venture capitalists will now choose a company using a blockchain to secure data and transactions over a company that isn't. That's becoming common sense. And the barrier to entry on creating a blockchain is not high. It's actually quite simple. 	Currently, companies are willing to pay good money to access your data and do so on a daily basis, without your knowledge or input. Blockchain technology can cut out the middlemen and allow consumers to authorize their own data as they see fit.	Focus on this space intently this year. Read. Learn. Educate yourself.	Why? Consumers are going to want solutions and security regarding their data. A paradigm shift is coming and that always means opportunity. If you can invert the process and give people control over their own data, you'll be meeting a growing need while creating a potentially very large business.	But on a smaller scale, even allowing that within your existing business will help with consumer confidence. 	Having control over your data means that you can charge companies for its usage, since you'll know every time someone wants to access it. ICOs like Sooloox are allowing consumers to authorize their data use, rather than simply provide it--reversing the marketing model by turning it into a consumer-led one. In an open data marketplace, consumers can trade their data like a commodity.	You don't need to be an expert in the technology itself. I'm not. But understanding emerging consumer needs (privacy, ownership of data) can help you predict where and how to position your startup to get funding or find customers, regardless of industry.",Change is scary.

23,Channelfutures.com,"Troy Gill | Mar 26, 2018	By Troy Gill, Manager of Security Research, AppRiver	In 2017 alone, more than 1.9 billion data records were lost or stolen, lining attackers' cyber pocketbooks with billions in bitcoin payments. Ransomware purveyors are not just getting richer — they are also getting smarter and creating more professional operations that mimic legitimate technology businesses.	With headlines mainly focusing on big-company breaches, such as the City of Atlanta or Uber, it's easy to understand why some small-to-midsize businesses let their guard down, thinking they can fly under the radar. Wrong. It’s a false sense of security, likely pushed along by the fact that SMBs often lack the tools and training needed to recognize, prevent and protect themselves from such attacks. As a trusted adviser, it's up to you to remind them that they can pay some now, or wait and come up with the money to pay attackers — plus a good public-relations team to help mitigate reputation damage.	MSPs can help their clients stay ahead of the game with prevention and protection, but making that sale might require showing them the financial impacts of an attack. On average, a security breach will cost an SMB $117,000 per incident, says a study by Kaspersky Lab and B2B International. Financial loss is not the only concern, either. Companies also face reputation damage that can quickly outweigh the cost of an actual breach. Consumers might avoid doing business with a company that has had a publicized breached. 	Once you have their attention, help SMB clients improve security and safeguard against attacks with three simple strategies: employee education; a security software suite; and data backup and recovery solutions. Managed security services will be a $40 billion market by 2022, and MSPs are in a prime position to grab a slice of the pie. 	It all starts by protecting the front line — their staff. The weakest links at any business are its employees, so education is key. Give people the tools and information they need to make informed decisions about email and web content and how to protect data and systems. Establish email policies in a manner that reduces risk of an attack, while addressing the organization’s specific challenges and goals. MSPs can help identify potential vulnerabilities by determining a baseline of end-user security practices. A good training program includes penetration testing, following up on the results and periodic quizzes to make sure staffers are following policies. An MSP can then tailor training to address areas where improvement is needed. That is not just helping the customer; it is also making the service provider an integral, visible part of the organization’s security team. 	Still, educating employees is just the first step. SMBs must also take action to safeguard their networks against ransomware by deploying a security suite that covers risk factors from multiple types of attacks.	The majority of emails are spam or contain malware and viruses. As a result, MSPs must offer their SMB customers a strong anti-spam service that puts a filter between the internet and their mail servers. Routing email messages through filters, which employ a number of continuously updated, sophisticated detection methods, ensures your customers get only legitimate messages. A security suite can also provide web-surfing protection at the DNS level to ensure each site is safe. Since there are thousands of malicious web pages discovered daily, MSPs must offer protection from malware and objectionable web content. By testing all web addresses against a continuously updated list of malicious websites and blocking them, MSPs can offer their clients up-to-the-minute protection. When a threat to the network is identified, a notification is sent and the attack is blocked.	Finally, MSPs can help clients with a layered security approach by building out data backup and recovery plans. Ransomware can find its way to external backup solutions connected to PCs, so online backups are by far the safest form of recovery from an attack. With an online recovery solution in place, businesses are able roll back to a clean state, before the infection, enabling MSPs to help undo damage. Current solutions take snapshot-based, incremental backups, as frequently as every five minutes, to create a series of recovery points. Since data is restored to a point in time before the ransomware infection, customers can be certain everything is clean, and the malware cannot be triggered again.	MSPs can play a critical role in helping clients stay ahead of the risks and better safeguard their businesses. Through a layered approach, encompassing training, a security software portfolio and recovery solutions, MSPs can help SMBs protect their businesses from threats on multiple fronts.

25,Cointelegraph By Ana Alexandre,"Cointelegraph	A cybercrime gang that allegedly targeted international financial organizations has been apprehended in Spain for stealing $1.24 bln.	News	The Spanish police have arrested a cybercrime gang made up of Russian and Ukrainian nationals who were allegedly involved in stealing more than $1.24 bln from financial institutions worldwide, subsequently converting their illicit gains into Bitcoin (BTC), Associated Press reports March 26.	According to statements issued by the Spanish police and Europol, the leader of the gang, a Ukrainian named “Denis K.” and his three suspected accomplices of Russian and Ukrainian origin, have been identified and arrested in the Spanish city of Alicante. Over a period of 5 years, the criminals have reportedly stolen more than 1 bln euros ($1.24 bln) from financial institutions across the globe.	The criminals were allegedly engaged in cybercrime, targeting more than 100 financial institutions and occasionally managing to get away with as much as 10 mln euros in each heist. As alleged by the authorities, almost all Russian banks were affected and about 50 of them did lose money in the attacks.	The gang gained access to internal banking networks by sending phishing emails with malicious attachments to bank officials. The malware provided the alleged perpetrators with control over affected hardware, allowing them to compromise ATMs and use the machines to withdraw unlimited sums of money.	AP reports that the cybercriminals didn’t spend the ill-obtained cash but instead exchanged it into bitcoins. Once converted, the cryptocurrency was used for purchasing different assets, including real estate and vehicles in Spain.	Back in February 2018, Thai Police apprehended a Russian citizen, Sergey Medvedev, said to be the number two person in an international cybercrime organization and administrator of the Dark Web site Infraud. The portal was used to sell stolen credit cards, identities and illegally obtained government documents. At the time of arrest, Medvedev was in possession of over 100,000 Bitcoins (BTC), roughly equal to $820 mln at the time.	Hide Comments			Thank you for contacting us!

27,V.I.A.,"Delta Optimist	Delta police are reminding the public that if you receive a phone call from a “government agency” that’s asking for payment in Bitcoin and threatening you with arrest, it’s a scam.	No government agencies ask for payment with Bitcoin, police say.	The DPD received three bitcoin specific fraud calls in one day last week. Two of the frauds involved callers claiming to be from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and one caller claimed to be from the DPD. Two of the frauds were completed and one was stopped by an alert taxi driver who was driving the victim to a Bitcoin machine.	“Some criminals prefer using Bitcoin because transactions are very difficult to trace,” the DPD said in a news release. “Chances are that if you send money via Bitcoin, you will never get it back.”
The DPD has provided residents with some tips to protect them from fraudsters posing as government workers:	* The government does not send you a text message when you owe money;	* The government will not pressure you to pay a fine in minutes or hours;	* The government does not accept payment in Bitcoin, gift cards or prepaid credit cards;	* Do not trust the number on your call display. Fraudsters may be using phone numbers that appear to come from the CRA or police, but these phone numbers can be easily mimicked by criminals through app technology;	* Don’t share more personal information, including banking information, over the phone.

28,Editor,"By Jake Anderson	The salient facts of the new Cambridge Analytica scandal are bad, and the optics are even worse for Facebook, which is already facing multiple battles both in legal courts and the court of public opinion. But this really is just the spilled pot of a long-boiling problem: growing discomfort within our citizen-consumer class over predatory data mining and the unaccountable shadow agencies and corporations being given access to our private lives via social networks. Big Brother has been privatized, and it may turn out to be far more dangerous than anything George Orwell predicted.	Typically, Facebook has been able to duck, dodge, juke, and jive its way out of such entanglements because of the sheer ubiquity of social media in our daily lives, the market value of the company, and its ability to manipulate public opinion. But this time is different. The company hit the politicized buzzsaw of the 2016 election, which is still grinding and sparking from accusations concerning the use of Facebook to spread propaganda (which in reality, of course, is nothing new). In other words, “Facebook’ is appearing in more and more paragraphs containing “Russia,” and in today’s climate, that is worse than a decade of privacy violations.	In Facebook’s meteoric rise, it flew too close to Trump on the wings of pilfered data.	With the #DeleteFacebook hashtag trending on social media and the Big Five — Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook — growing more untrustworthy by the day, we may soon see a sea change in public sentiment toward another relevant trend with incredible momentum: peer-to-peer, blockchain-based tech apps; tools that do not harvest user data and are not part of a monopolistic predator class of Silicon Valley tech elites hobnobbing with Washington policymakers. The masses may finally be ready to adopt the ethos of decentralized social media in their lives.	There are six primary reasons why we need our social media run through the blockchain technology: distributed consensus mechanisms ensure better security and privacy; blockchain eliminates censorship and safeguards freedom of speech by anonymizing user meta-data; in a blockchain, you aren’t the product (your meta-data is not harvested for commercial gain); by eliminating a central server, users have more control over their own content; blockchain’s tokens, coins, and smart contacts make transactions, payments, and peer-to-peer commerce smoother; decentralized networks sans external payment methods mean crowdfunding for startups is much easier.	The uses of blockchain continue to grow exponentially. Current projects are to blockchain’s future potential what steam was to energy production. In other words, this is only the beginning. With that said, here is a list of 10 new blockchain projects that could become the decentralized Davids to Facebook’s Goliath:	Steemit – Steemit is a kind of decentralized Reddit where users can earn the crypto coin Steem by posting and curating content. Steemit is one of the only blockchain-based social media platforms with hundreds of thousands of mainstream users, and it is one of the best examples of blockchain-as-backend and serverless architecture. Steemit is also viewed as a gateway coin that helps people who don’t know much about cryptocurrency get involved in the blockchain ecosystem.	onG.social – onG social is a blockchain social media dashboard for influencers and users. It is only the second company in history to run on two blockchains — Ethereum and Wave — which makes its encryption measures more stable and secure. In fact, the infrastructure is so promising that IBM has lent its support. Like others on this list, onG social is a decentralized network and rewards users who post content with cryptocurrency. onG social also supports two other important crypto projects: Golem, which aims to decentralize supercomputing power, and Storj, which distributes data storing nodes.	Sola.ai – Another next-gen decentralized social network that lets users monetize their content. Powered by the Sol utility token, Sola uses artificial intelligence algorithms and user reactions to “generate revenue from advertising, user payments and partnerships.” The Sola ecosystem creates an internal market for its own community-developed apps and then splits the revenue with users. Its decentralized architecture makes it impossible to shut down, and the creators claim it is “immune to blocking and censorship.”	MeWe – MeWe is a “next-gen social network” that hashtags itself #not4sale. It is considered a possible Twitter substitute. Founded by online privacy advocate Mark Weinstein, MeWe has no ads, no censorship, and no tracking.	Obsidian – Obsidian is a possible replacement for Facebook Messenger, a proof-of-stake, Stratis-based blockchain that can bypass “cookie” censors and surveillance. The data is not used for analytics and advertising. Peter McClory, CEO of Obsidian, explains that the decentralized approach scatters the metadata across the globe. “Running a decentralized network doesn’t come for free, somebody has to pay to run the hosts,” McClory adds. “That’s why we needed a cryptocurrency that can pay rewards to node hosts so that they have a financial incentive to run decentralized messaging nodes. Which in turn takes the decentralization a step further, as this removes any financial incentive for the Company to run advertising or sell user data (if they had access to that, which they won’t).”	Nexus – Nexus is a blockchain-based social media application where users can “make deals or exchange value through cryptographically-signed and executed contracts.” The decentralized system boasts secure authentication and anonymity for users worried about censorship by a repressive government. Founder Jade Mulholland says the goal is to “eliminate all invasion of privacy that large corporations are currently performing.” Mulholland adds that “Social, our cryptocurrency, can be used to do many things on the social network, such as buying and selling in the marketplace, purchasing ad space, and donating to crowdfunding campaigns.”	Indorse – Indorse is an Ethereum blockchain-based alternative to LinkedIn that promotes a “skills economy” with its own currency. This system is vaguely similar to Steemit’s in that it rewards users with its own tokens in exchange for helping them build the platform. According to Gaurang Torvekar, CTO & co-founder at Indorse, the use of Ethereum to complement other emerging technologies could lead to a social media revolution. “Combining the Ethereum Blockchain with payment channels opens up a gamut of features and autonomous abilities, aligned with financial incentives. Smart contracts paired with payment channels provide the computation and logic layer upon which the core engine of such a platform can be built.”	Synereo – Synereo and its native cryptocurrency, AMP, “offer blockchain-enabled Attention Economy solutions, allowing direct and platform agnostic monetization of original content posted anywhere on the net.” Synereo’s first tool, Wildspark, allows content to be monetized via “a distributed meta-layer on top of existing media hubs and social networks, where users are incentivized to reward both creators and curators directly with AMP, without the media hub, social network – or Synereo – taking a cut.”	Akasha – Akasha aspires to be a truly revolutionary platform where anyone from artists to mathematicians can communicate without fear of censorship. With a Twitter-like interface and its own tokens, Akasha is hard to pin down, but its creator, the founder of Bitcoin Magazine, describes their mission thusly: “By fusing Ethereum with the Inter-Planetary File System, we explore the implications and applications of a permanent Web in the context of freedom of expression, creative perpetuity, and privacy for a better home of Mind.”	Leeroy.io – Leeroy is referred to as a Twitter clone that tips you. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Leeroy requires a MetaMask install and is expensive and hard to use. However, it “represents the complete disintermediation of Twitter and the death knell of the ad-driven business model…In the future, all social networks will be like Leeroy: a public utility that lives on the Internet, which leaves users in control of their data, fairly compensates content creators for their efforts, is agnostic and unopinioned as to the data that flows on top of it, fully community-owned and governed, and built for users.”	This article (10 Decentralized Social Media Networks to Use Instead of Facebook) was originally published on Activist Post and syndicated by The Event Chronicle.

29,Jana J. Pruet,"A recent study showed that more than 20 percent of college students are risking some of their student loan money to invest in cryptocurrency.	The survey, conducted by the Student Loan Report, posed one question to 1,000 college students over the course of four days earlier this month. The students were asked: “Have you ever used student loan money to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?”	According to the results, 21.2 percent of college kids have used some of their student loan money to purchase cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum’s Ether, Ripple’s XRP, and others.		Student loan money isn’t used exclusively for tuition. Many college students have loans that help cover their “living expenses,” or they borrow more than they need and end up receiving a refund at the end of the semester, which students can use at their discretion.	Apparently, a large number of students believe investing in virtual money is a smart use of those funds and could possibly help them pay off student loan debt.	But it’s a risky investment. While Digital currencies were a hot trend in 2017, many have lost significant value since the beginning of the year. For example, in December, Bitcoin peaked at more than $19,000. Now, it’s trading below $8,000.	Using student loans to buy cryptocurrency isn’t allowed, according to regulations set by the Department of Education.	The regulations state that loans for living expenses must be related to education, Forbes reported.	Approved posts to MyVoice will be live on the site within a few hours.

30,Cointelegraph By Helen Partz,"Cointelegraph	1 out 5 US students use their student loans to invest in crypto, while industry insiders prefer to take pay in crypto.	News	According to recent news media reports, US students and employees tend to deal with cryptocurrencies more often: college students use loan money to invest in digital currencies, while crypto industry workers get paid in cryptocurrency.	According to a survey conducted between March 16-20 by the Student Loan Report, 21.2 percent of college students have used loan money to fund cryptocurrency investment. The students were attempting to take advantage of upward price volatility in Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) to pay off their debts faster.	Taking into account the fact that Bitcoin prices soared from $1,000 to $20,000 in 2017, the move might look like a good idea. However, using loan money for investing in an extremely volatile market could result in higher debt, especially when considering student loan interest rates.	The volatility does not appear to scare industry insiders who prefer to take their pay in cryptocurrency. CNBC reported March 26, that 52 employees of BitPay payment processor prefer to get their salaries fully in Bitcoin, without combining any part of their salary with fiat money.	Jeremie Beaudry, a regulatory affairs counsel at BitPay who is now being paid in Bitcoin on a weekly basis, says that he “[does not] really care about fluctuations… I am from the traditional banking world… But I think my approach to finance has changed. ...Not being in it is worse than being involved in it. ""	According to CNBC, 40 percent of employees at cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase take some fraction of their salaries in Bitcoin.	Last year, Medici fintech firm offered its employees to take an annual bonus in Bitcoin. Jonathan Johnson, president of Medici Ventures, noted that he only considers those funds as a long-term investment.	""I am long-term bullish on it; that was an easy decision for me, but the bonus is worth less today than when I got it.""	According to Johnson, paying employees in cryptocurrencies should be “exponentially cheaper” than using the traditional banking system. Though there are a number of payroll companies that offered employers a scheme to pay workers in crypto, it is still “more about employees asking for the option than corporate treasurers trying to save money,” according to Nathalie McGrath, director of people at Coinbase.

31,Thomas Delahunty,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	According to a letter written by Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) President Chris Concannon, U.S. securities regulators should not stand in the way of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold cryptocurrencies from coming to the market, as they are essentially the same as other ETFs that hold commodities.	The letter was in response to statements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, in which the agency said “significant investor protection issues” need to be examined before Bitcoin-based ETFs could be offered. The SEC also had concerns around how the products would be priced, stored, and safeguarded, according to Reuters.	Dalia Blass, the director of the SEC’s investment management division wrote: “Until the questions identified above can be addressed satisfactorily, we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products.”	Cboe believes ETFs would give investors a more transparent and accessible way to get exposure to cryptocurrencies than the spot market. As per Concannon’s letter: “the vast majority of these [the SEC’s] concerns can be addressed within the existing framework for commodity-related funds related to valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage, and manipulation.”	The purpose of Cboe’s letter isn’t to rush the SEC into making a decision, according to Concannon, but rather to “point out areas that can be satisfied” and advocate for the “development of the marketplace.” The exchange asked the SEC to evaluate each cryptocurrency fund and underlying cryptocurrency-related holdings on a case-by-case basis.	“This has been a priority for us since we approached the SEC almost a year ago with the Winklevoss brothers and their original Bitcoin filing,” Concannon said.	Cboe has helped usher Bitcoin to mainstream banking, launching the first market for Bitcoin futures in the U.S. in December of last year. That followed an earlier attempt by Bats — an exchange acquired by Cboe in 2017 — to trade a Bitcoin-ETF from the Winklevoss twins.	A Bitcoin ETF was viewed as a natural next step in Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset after this launch of futures. In response to regulatory issues, however, a number of issuers have withdrawn their applications for a Bitcoin fund. As of now, about a dozen Bitcoin-linked ETFs are sitting in regulatory limbo, waiting for approval.	More than $70 billion in Bitcoin traded hands in the spot market in December when the price reached about $20,000, according to Cboe. Such liquidity would easily support bitcoin ETFs or other exchange-traded products (ETPs), the exchange asserted.	“As the volumes continue to grow, especially on regulated U.S. markets, the overall spot Bitcoin market looks more and more like a traditional commodity market and Cboe continues to believe that the spot market is sufficiently liquid to support a Bitcoin ETP [exchange traded product].”	Get the latest news delivered to your inbox.

32,CBC News,"Canada's fraud watchdog says scam activity tends to increase during tax time, and warns Manitobans to be on the watch for sketchy situations.	""Generally in the past we've seen an influx of scams surrounding tax season. In the form of phishing email, like it's coming from the CRA: 'congratulations, you have a refund,'"" said Jessica Gunson, spokesperson for the Canadian Ant-Fraud Centre.	But now those same scams are showing up as unsolicited text messages, she said. 	""It looks like an Interac email money transfer, it looks like you have a refund from the CRA,"" said Gunson. ""The key to remember here is the Canada Revenue Agency would never email you or send you a text message to notify you of a refund.""	Another scam becoming more frequent is where the caller tells the victim they owe money for back taxes and if they don't pay it off, they could be arrested.	Some new Canadians are even told they could be deported if they don't pay up. ""This is a scary call for them to receive,"" said Gunson. 	She says scammers sometimes tell people to pay off their 'back taxes' in iTunes gift cards or even bitcoin, demonstrating how willing scammers are to utilize new technology — which also makes it harder to follow the money.	""There was a file that [recently] came through, the individual was told to send $5,000 [in bitcoin],"" said Gunson, who added the person avoided being defrauded thanks to a well-placed warning. 	""There was actually a notice on top of the bitcoin ATM warning them about this scam. And that person, they were able to kind of step back and go 'Wait a second,' and didn't lose the money.""	However, another person lost $200,000 to the same bitcoin scam, said Gunson. 	If someone does fall prey to these scammers, the best thing to do is report it to the centre as well as the police, she said, even if the victim is ashamed of what happened.	""There's no embarrassment. They should never feel ashamed because they've fallen for a scam; they're not alone,"" said Gunson. ""Our phone rings here day in and day out from consumers that have lost money.""	Only about five per cent of victims report their losses to the centre, said Gunson. Which is a shame because the more reports they receive the easier it is for the centre to track trends and issue warnings.	""Sometimes it's just a one-off piece of information that helps connect the dots.""	Gunson said she'd like to see more financial literacy skills taught, especially to young people, to help prevent these kinds of scams in the future.	""If every Canadian recognized a scam, would delete the email, delete the text, hang up the phone, it would stop scammers in their tracks,"" she said.

33,Jeremy Epstein,"Ready to start building Dapps? Dive deep into blockchain development. Subscribe Now	NOW READING:	Op Ed: Why Korea Could Be the First Cryptocurrency-Powered Nation			Some country out there is going to be the first “Crypto-Powered Nation.” That would be one that has widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, serves as a global hotbed for crypto-innovation, runs enterprise-grade scalable blockchain infrastructure and has a balanced relationship with government.	South Korea could be one and it is one place that may be worth watching over the next few years. Here’s why I think so.	Some estimates put cryptocurrency ownership in the country as high as 33 percent of the adult population. The concept of digital asset ownership is mainstream. Granted, it was speculation, jealousy and competition that drove much of the initial interest in bitcoin. At one point, prices peaked at nearly 40 percent higher than foreign exchanges. The phenomenon is known as the ""Kimchi premium.” 	The end result is that the crypto-infrastructure is in place to handle a large number of customers and almost everyone in the country has heard of the concept. That’s a huge hurdle in the evolution toward daily, mainstream usage. When all is said and done, Korea is the third biggest cryptocurrency market in the world and you cannot become a Crypto-Nation if people don’t even know the technology exists.	Market observers have witnessed that rumors of cryptocurrency regulation from Korea can jolt prices severely upwards or downwards. The country’s on-again, off-again ban of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) has left some people confused in the short term, but many Korean crypto-insiders are optimistic.	The current government, led by President Moon Jae-in, relies heavily on the support of the young adult population. Not surprisingly, this is the same demographic that is highly invested in crypto -assets. As one of the first (if not the first) generations to grow up in an era of relative prosperity, the Korean millennials can afford to take chances with their investments in ways that an older, more cost-conscious generation may not have been able to do.	As Henry Lee, Head of Growth at Seoul-based Icon (currently #23 on CoinMarketCap) said, “The government needs the young people to stay in power, and young adults love crypto. They are not going to mess that up.”	Two things are happening in Korea that further drive advanced understanding of cryptocurrencies.  The first is the utilization of Korean crypto markets as a vehicle for getting money out of China.  The second is the existence of embargoes on North Korea. Both of these factors drive innovation at exchanges and service providers.	Despite the “official news to the contrary,” many observers of the Korean crypto-ecosystem see plenty of evidence that Korean markets are being used by Chinese citizens and businesses to get money out of China. Chinese citizens are notoriously prohibited from exporting more than $15,400 worth of cash. In Korea, I heard from various sources that Chinese businesses have been buying Korean businesses and then using them to move money as well. Some of these funds are then moved into cryptocurrency. 	Then there is the North Korean embargo factor.	With the Trump administration imposing new sanctions on North Korea, the rumor is that aid to the embattled North is actually being funneled through crypto channels that cannot be tracked by traditional means or American watchdogs. Additionally, North Korea may be mining cryptocurrency on its own and may be in need of an avenue to get it out of the country. There is also evidence to suggest the North Koreans are targeting exchanges in order to steal cryptocurrencies as well.   	As Sonny Kwon, publisher of leading Korean blockchain publication TokenPost told me, “People in the blockchain space know that massive amounts of money are coming in from China, and possibly much [is] headed to North through hacking and money laundering.”	Between the money coming in and going out, Korean exchanges like Bithumb and the network of providers that support them are seeing a huge amount of activity. The end result is that they are being forced to innovate on security and scaling solutions. After all, not too many other exchanges are facing state-sponsored cyber threats. Koreans are.	It may be money laundering and cyber-theft that are driving innovation, but the solutions should pay huge dividends in other sectors down the road.  We’ve seen this happen with other industries like pornography where early innovation and utilization (e.g. how the use of video cassettes drove VCR purchases) drove subsequent growth and innovation in other verticals. 	The in-country knowledge could ultimately trickle down to benefit other South Korean companies in the blockchain industry. This, in turn, would give them a competitive advantage by allowing these companies to test and refine a lot of these systems at enterprise scale within the country. 	Last year, Metaps+, a digital couponing company successfully completed the first Korean-based ICO. Prior to that, others, like ICON which raised $45 million (at the time) in their ICO, had based their foundation in Zug, Switzerland (a.k.a “Crypto Valley”) and other locations. However, Metaps+ showed that a successful ICO could happen in Korea. Since then, its founder, Seungyeon Kim, has achieved a type of K-pop rockstar status in the Korean crypto-community for his willingness to take the risk in an uncertain regulatory environment. 	Admittedly, there have only been five ICOs in Korea in total, but the trail has been blazed. Now there are at least 50 pure blockchain startups (that’s more than are actually based in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley), four blockchain-dedicated publications, 50 blockchain-related events monthly, and 1000+ crypto-related groups on social networks services like Kakao. A recent conference in Seoul, TokenSky, attracted over 1,000 people, and a company called FoundationX has 10 “reverse ICOs” of existing Korean companies in its pipeline. None of these numbers are huge, but they are growing rapidly.	All of this innovation is happening in a market already known for its high degree of digital connectivity. Anyone who has struggled with losing cell phone coverage in a tunnel will appreciate that every subway car on the Seoul Metro system has not just one or two wi-fi routers, but four. Over 92 percent of Koreans are connected to the internet, and 71 percent have a smartphone (the fourth highest rate in the world). It is no surprise that in this mobile-first environment, gaming companies use Korea as a test bed for new products. The size of the mobile games market is second only to Japan. In short, Koreans are used to trying things out first when it comes to digital tech, and word spreads quickly	Finally, the Korean education system is producing the engineering talent to power blockchain innovation. A recent study placed the country second only to Singapore for its math and science scores. Over 68 percent of Koreans aged 25 to 34 have a bachelor’s degree, and six of the top 200 engineering schools in the world are in South Korea. 	Jung-hee Ryu, a Ph.D with a successful exit of his own and now CEO of Seoul-based FuturePlay, one of the leading tech incubators in Seoul, remarked, “Korean universities are turning out some of the most talented blockchain engineers in the world, and an entire ecosystem is rapidly evolving to help them accelerate their time-to-market.’	I was in Seoul earlier this month to keynote at the Digital Marketing Summit, Korea’s largest marketing conference, with over 1,000 attendees. The topic was the future of marketing in a blockchain world.	When I've spoken at events in other countries, I ask how many in the crowd own bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Usually somewhere between 5 and 33 percent will raise their hands. In this audience, nearly everyone did. Korean marketers, business leaders and innovators are well past the initial euphoria. They are looking toward the future of how crypto -assets will be used and deployed at national scale.  	Combine all that with an intense culture of achievement, a drive for economic success and an increasingly global outlook as the country has vaulted to become one of the top 10 economies worldwide, and you have the recipe for a powerful cycle of innovation.	I have absolutely no idea what the first “Crypto-powered Nation” will look like or when it will happen. All I am saying is that there a few key ingredients that will be components of a country that runs on blockchains and cryptocurrencies. From my perspective, many of the things that need to be there — experience at enterprise scale, government relationships, academic and technical talent and widespread awareness — are all present in South Korea.	That’s why I am keeping an eye on the market.

	Four days after the announcement of a ransomware attack on Atlanta's city network on March 22, officials are still struggling to bring citizen-facing websites and internal application back online.	In a March 23 announcement, the city provided an update on efforts to resolve the ransomware cyberattack and outlined precautionary measures employees and customers should take while the city restores service.	Because the attack seems to have affected applications residents use to pay bills or do business with the city, officials initially advised employees and those who do business with the city to check their bank accounts to ensure their financial data had not been compromised.	On Monday, the city reiterated that that warning in a tweet. ""At this time, there is no evidence to show that customer or employee data has been compromised. However, customers and employees are encouraged to take precautionary measures to monitor and protect their personal information.""	Agencies across the city have been affected, according to a press statement. Among the departmental functions still suspended are:	In an interview with WSB-TV Atlanta, Mayor Keisha Bottoms said the city is making progress, but the issue is not resolved.  More details have not been forthcoming.	Some have criticized the city's reticence. Andy Green, a lecturer of information and security at Kennesaw State University, told Atlanta NBC affiliate WXIA that the city's silence is concerning. ""We don't know if they're actively fighting the infection, we don't know whether they're into recovery mode,"" Green said.	The ransomware message demanded a bitcoin payment of approximately $51,000 to unlock all affected systems, the equivalent of $6,800 per computer to unlock individual machines.	About the Author

36,RT,"Mavrodi was rushed to a hospital from a bus stop late on Monday night, after he complained of a chest pain, Moskovsky Komsomolets reported. He died later in the morning. 	Mavrodi became a household name in Russia soon after he co-founded his brainchild, MMM, in the early 1990s. It’s believed that “MMM” stands for the first letters of the three founders’ surnames (Sergey Mavrodi, Olga Melnikova and Vyacheslav Mavrodi.) Others say the pyramid’s name stood for Mavrodi Mondial Moneybox.	But the million-dollar question is how the pyramid grandmaster, Mavrodi, managed to turn his Ponzi-scheme into such a success in Russia in the 1990s.	1. MMM lured people in with promises of annual returns of up to 1,000 percent. The desire for a quick buck won Mavrodi an army of subscribers, ready to mortgage their houses to buy some MMM shares.	2. MMM quickly gained widespread popularity and managed to target millions of private investors in Russia, thanks to a series of commercials played on all TV channels at the time. In one of them, ‘ordinary bloke’ Lenya Golubkov told potential investors how easy it is to earn some cash. In one popular ad, Lenya said he decided to invest his money in MMM, and two weeks later his revenues grew a whopping 100%, so he could finally buy his wife a pair of new boots.	3. Point-of-sale terminals operated across the country on a 24/7 basis, with MMM shares and checks selling like hot cakes.	4. In the five years that the financial pyramid existed, MMM produced as many as 27 million shares and 72 million checks. 	5. By 1994, MMM had some 15 million investors, driven by hope, naivety and mass euphoria.	Obviously, this couldn’t last forever. Mavrodi’s Ponzi scheme finally had a great fall. In August 1994, Mavrodi was arrested on suspicion of tax evasion. While under arrest, he managed to get himself elected to Russia’s State Duma. In 1996, Mavrodi even tried to run for president, but was not allowed to run in the elections.	In 1997, MMM was declared bankrupt.	“Back in 1994, when MMM had almost a third of the country's budget, I did not acquire anything. It was not interesting to me. I lived in this same apartment,” Mavrodi recalled, in his “Rules of Life” interview for Russia’s Esquire magazine. “Back then, it looked like this: three rooms, clogged with bookshelves from floor to ceiling and, in the middle of each room, there was a huge aquarium of four sections. There was nothing else. Only a bed and a table. When [the police] came for me, they were in shock – the detainee walked around the apartment wearing a jumpsuit, while in the apartment there were only fish aquariums, two cats, a parrot and many, many books.”	While there’s no precise data on how many people fell prey to Mavrodi’s financial pyramid fraud, according to some estimates over a million people lost investments. In early 2003, Mavrodi was arrested on charges of fraud and tax evasion. The fraudster was sentenced to 4.5 years’ imprisonment. Three years later he was released and, amazingly enough, founded another financial pyramid.	Mavrodi’s last version of MMM was launched in China in 2015. Members of the network had to buy bitcoins, later sent as ""mutual aid"" to those who came to the fund earlier.	Participants were promised a modest 30 percent return per month. “MMM isn’t a financial pyramid. MMM is just a dispatcher,” the ambitious Russian businessman told the Financial Times in 2015. “If I refuse using Bitcoin tomorrow, it will fall down,” the pyramid guru claimed. 	Like this story?

	A JavaScript / Python / PHP library for cryptocurrency trading and e-commerce with support for many bitcoin/ether/altcoin exchange markets and merchant APIs.	The CCXT library is used to connect and trade with cryptocurrency / altcoin exchanges and payment processing services worldwide. It provides quick access to market data for storage, analysis, visualization, indicator development, algorithmic trading, strategy backtesting, bot programming, webshop integration and related software engineering.	It is intended to be used by coders, developers, technically-skilled traders, data-scientists and financial analysts for building trading algorithms on top of it.	Current feature list:	ccxt on GitHub | Install | Usage | Manual | Examples | Changelog | Contributing	The ccxt library currently supports the following 105 cryptocurrency exchange markets and trading APIs:	The list above is updated frequently, new crypto markets, altcoin exchanges, bug fixes, API endpoints are introduced and added on a regular basis. See the Manual for details. If you don’t find a cryptocurrency exchange market in the list above and/or want another exchange to be added, post or send us a link to it by opening an issue here on GitHub or via email.	The library is under MIT license, that means it’s absolutely free for any developer to build commercial and opensource software on top of it, but use it at your own risk with no warranties, as is.	The easiest way to install the ccxt library is to use builtin package managers:	This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:	You can also clone it into your project directory from ccxt GitHub repository:	An alternative way of installing this library into your code is to copy a single file manually into your working directory with language extension appropriate for your environment.	JavaScript version of CCXT works both in Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and async/await syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is not excluded in your babel-loader config.	ccxt in **NPM**	All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from unpkg CDN, which is a fast, global content delivery network for everything on NPM.	Creates a global ccxt object:	ccxt in **PyPI**	The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.5.3+	The ccxt library in PHP: **``ccxt.php``**	It requires common PHP modules:	Read the Manual for more details.	The ccxt library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part out-of-the-box immediately after installation. Public APIs open access to public information from all exchange markets without registering user accounts and without having API keys.	Public APIs include the following:	For trading with private APIs you need to obtain API keys from/to exchange markets. It often means registering with exchanges and creating API keys with your account. Most exchanges require personal info or identification. Some kind of verification may be necessary as well. If you want to trade you need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchange APIs expose interface methods for registering an account from within the code itself, but most of exchanges don’t. You have to sign up and create API keys with their websites.	Private APIs allow the following:	This library implements full public and private REST APIs for all exchanges. WebSocket and FIX implementations in JavaScript, PHP, Python and other languages coming soon.	The ccxt library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.	Read the Manual for more details.	Please read the CONTRIBUTING document before making changes that you would like adopted in the code. Also, read the Manual for more details.	We are investing a significant amount of time into the development of this library. If CCXT made your life easier and you like it and want to help us improve it further or if you want to speed up new features and exchanges, please, support us with a tip.

38,Scott Scanlon,"Now they could be staring down some major tax liabilities. But how tax laws apply to virtual currencies like bitcoin and ethereum is still a gray area that confuses people.	 “I think a lot of people who got in to cryptocurrency maybe didn’t even think about the tax implications,” says Janna Herron, a tax researcher and writer at Value Penguin. The Internal Revenue Service says virtual currency transactions are taxable by law.	 The agency issued its first and only guidance on how tax principles apply to transactions using cryptocurrency in 2014. “The one notice is considered tax authority,” says Sarah-Jane Morin, an attorney in the tax practice group at Morgan Lewis.	 “It isn’t as binding as regulations, but it is all we have to go on.” The guidance says that for tax purposes, cryptocurrencies should be treated as property, not currency.	 And cryptocurrencies, in this guidance, include anything that is considered a “convertible virtual currency,” which means it has an equivalent value in real currency or acts as a substitute for real currency. Not all cryptocurrencies act this way, but most of the major ones, like bitcoin, do.

39,Dalmas Ngetich,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	According to statistics, 97% of all coins listed in the Top 100 list as per CoinMarketCap compilation are in the red. Ontology is the only gainer adding 12.56% while Bitcoin is down 8% trading below $8,000.	Basing our finding on price action, we expect further depreciation with EOS possibly reversing last week’s gains and LTC testing $100 or lower by week’s end.	Let’s have a look at these charts:	XLM/USD Bittrex 4HR Chart for March 27, 2018	By press time, Lumens was down 9.23% according to CoinMarketCap statistics. Unfortunately, it seems like Stellar Lumens sellers are just getting started and gearing towards last week’s lows of $0.15.	This is just what the charts hints and coming at a time when Stellar Lumens is receiving awesome developments.	In my view, today sellers should look to ramp up their sells and trade according to the general negative outlay. If there are attempts of higher highs then $0.25 to $0.30 should be ideal sell zones.	IOT/USD BitFinex Weekly Chart for March 27, 2018	After yesterday’s price action, IOTA sellers are firmly on the driving seat. Because of this, chances of IOTA trading at parity with the USD remain high. Fact is IOTA might even trade lower if this sell pressure persists.	Stochastics in the weekly and 4HR charts are negative. Besides, we take a top down approach and prioritize price development in the weekly chart.	There it’s clear that not only can bears be overambitious and targets $0.85 but they can look forward for further erosion with the bull’s eye at $0.30. That’s October 2017 lows and the stem of Q4 IOTA rally.	EOS/USD BitFinex 4HR Chart for March 27, 2018	Sellers are on a rampage and to put things in perspective, EOS is down 18% in the last 24 hours and reacting from the resistance trend line. In my view, the degradation is just picking up momentum.	If we base our limits on price action then we can as well pick potential support or the ideal bear targets at $4. That’s March 18 lows and the foundation of last week’s 58% gain.	Not this though, if you want to trade this pair then it could help if you wait for stochastics sell signal to form in the 4HR chart before shorting.	Even if prices might recover, the current bear trend is only beneficial for those who are already in the trade. Anyway, any form of EOS recovery means sellers can stand by and wait for sell signals anywhere between $6.5 and $7.5.	LTC/USD CoinBase 4HR Chart for March 27, 2018	If we base our analysis from yesterday’s preview then we can see that prices are generally bearish and LTC bulls didn’t push prices above the resistance trend line. As such the series of bear candlesticks from the liquidation line is wonderful but sad from an investor’s perspective.	Zooming out and basing our analysis on the weekly chart, it’s evident that sellers are eye balling $90 or there about. Coincidentally, that’s the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement line.	Considering this bear momentum, it will not be rocket to project that if bears clears March 18 lows at $135, then $100 is an open goal even if LTC sellers may experience rejection along the way.	NEO/USD Bittrex Daily Chart for March 27, 2018	Initially, March 25 consolidation could have been a short term spring board for NEO prices but as price action means our stop loss was hit.	Overly, we remain bearish meaning traders should look for sell opportunities whenever it arises. Sometime bear target is $50 and any break below that then it’s likely that we might slide towards $25.

40,Guest Post," 	In a recent announcement, Google’s Sustainable Ads Director, Scott Spencer, said his company will be updating its policies on financial service-related advertising to disallow adverts related to cryptocurrency content.	Soon after Google made public its decision to ban crypto-related adverts, another giant social networking platform, Twitter, announced its intention to disallow such adverts in less than a fortnight.	The Google ban will take effect in June and will prohibit any form of advertising aimed at marketing initial coin offerings (ICOs), trading advise, wallets among other crypto business activities. Both Twitter and Google announcements come barely a month after Facebook took a similar move.	Get Rich Quick	The astronomical growth in cryptocurrencies has generated interest among investors. With it, there has been a proliferation of online adverts, most of which are scams intended to defraud vulnerable investors. Internet companies cite lack of sufficient frameworks to guarantee consumer protection as the reason behind the bans.	Globally, regulators have issued several messages warning investors of the risks posed by the crypto market. Due to these warnings, internet companies view crypto-related advertisement, particularly those that position them as ‘get rich quick’ schemes, as harmful to their users.	Bojan Oremuz, CEO and founder of Emmares, says, “This move was supposedly triggered by many scams and untruthful ICOs that were harming their users. I agree that ads using sentences like ‘use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin’ are not appropriate and are misleading various and in many cases the most vulnerable segments.”	The Impact	On the flipside, Oremuz feels that the move taken by the internet firms will have an irreversible damage in the cryptocurrency industry.	He says, “I also believe strongly that this means those prohibitions will result in irreparable damage in the crypto world. Since the crypto market is based on investors who contribute to ICOs they believe in, the loss of billions of impressions from Facebook and Google platforms may very well be a big factor to reducing new investments.”	The impact of the Google ban on crypto-related ads was evident. Google’s announcement sent cryptocurrency prices on a downward spiral until Bitcoin trade reached $8201 after losing by more than 10% of its value, based on Bitstamp exchange data. This is the lowest this currency has reached this month.	For leading currencies like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple, this slump in price is likely to wear off soon because they are already popular and do not require advertising. However, Andrei Huseu, CEO of Wealthman, holds that the impact of steps taken by internet companies to ban crypto ads need to be viewed both in the short and long term.	“The impact of Google actions should be assessed in both short term and long term. In the short term, this decision probably has a negative effect as it creates a negative information background, which is very important for a volatile market, such as cryptocurrency market. It also can greatly complicate the conduct of marketing campaigns of ICO projects,” he says.	But in the long run, Huseu is optimistic the Google ban will strengthen the market by weeding out scam coins and scheming actors thus providing stability.	“In the long term, however, this decision can make the whole industry less attractive to the scum projects, therefore will improve the market conditions,” he adds.	According to Denis Farnosov, founder and CEO of AlfaToken, even with internet companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook banning crypto ads, all is not lost. ICO companies can explore alternative mediums to market their projects.	He says, “Marketing through increased community engagement on social platforms, message boards and forums should be implemented. This means ICO Founders must engage with the community. Tools like AMAs are effective for telling the story directly to the audience. Press releases can be used as a marketing tool if they are written in a news style where value is added for the reader. I believe these channels will profit from this decision of Google and Facebook.”	Disclaimer: David Drake is on the advisory board for most of the firms mentioned or quoted in this article.

	Litecoin dropped Monday after news that payments processor LitePay has ceased operations, prompting an apology from the coin's founder for promoting the start-up. 	The cryptocurrency traded roughly 10 percent lower near $145 as of 4:08 p.m. ET, according to CoinMarketCap. Litecoin is down about 28.5 percent for the month and 37.5 percent for the year so far.	Litecoin rallied in mid-February, partly due to LitePay's announcement that its merchant payment processing system for litecoin would go live on Feb. 26. But in an email to customers on March 5, LitePay said it is still ""checking all perspective merchants"" and is holding off on card registrations ""due to the negative perception and drastic actions card issuers have towards cryptocurrency companies."" The company has not sent out an update since.	Litecoin 12-month performance		Source: CoinMarketCap	On Monday, the Litecoin Foundation, a nonprofit for advancing litecoin and an investor in LitePay, said on its website that LitePay CEO Kenneth Asare informed the organization a ""couple days ago"" that  ""he has ceased all operations and is preparing to sell the company.""	The foundation said it refused Asare's request for further funding after a Reddit ""Ask me anything"" session on March 16 raised questions about how the funds were being used. 	""Like everyone else, we got too excited about something that was too good to be true and we optimistically overlooked many of the warning signs,"" litecoin creator Charlie Lee said in a tweet. ""I am sorry for having hyped up this company and vow to do better due diligence in the future."" 		Lee said in December he ""sold and donated"" nearly all his litecoin holdings.	In February, Asare said in an email to CNBC that his team has been working on development since the summer of 2017. ""Our goal is to create a way for merchants to earn Litecoin, which is a particularly good cryptocurrency for payments,"" he said. 	Asare did not immediately respond to a CNBC email for comment Monday. 	Litecoin is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $8.1 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Its declines Monday came as other cryptocurrencies also fell. Bitcoin dropped 7 percent to below $8,000. 	""Litecoin was doing perfectly fine before the promise of LitePay and will continue to do so,"" the Litecoin Foundation said on its website.	U.S. regulators and companies have taken steps in the last few months to crack down on fraudulent activity in cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has frozen the assets of those involved with some token sales, and Texas has issued several cease-and-desist orders on cryptocurrency companies. On Monday, Twitter followed Google and Facebook in announcing a ban on advertising for cryptocurrencies. 		Playing	Share this video...

42,WGCL Digital Team,"As a new work week begins, many are wondering if Atlanta is back to full speed following a cyberattack on the city's computer systems last week.	It all depends on the department. Some departments were not affected at all by the cyberattack, while employees in others are still not able to turn on their computers.	The fire and police departments were not affected at all by the ransomware attack. The same goes for the public works department, housing authority and Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, although the airport has suspended its Wi-fi services, just in case.

For example, if you have an issue with trash pickup, traffic signals and potholes, you'll have to resolve it over the phone. Also, the city jail is having to process inmates manually.	Business owner Marcus Woodard was among the people turned away Monday at Atlanta City Hall. He was looking to renew his business license but the computers are still down.	""I commuted all this way to get it, and now I've got to come back tomorrow or the day after,"" said Woodard. 	On the other hand, Doug Lueder walked out a happy man after his application to have a commercial property subdivided was handled.	""I had to turn in an application last week just before the cyberattack happened, so I got in and got out,"" said Lueder. ""Today, I was just turning in my notarized sign posting affidavit so that went pretty easy also, so all in all, I got out pretty easy."" 	Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms provided an update on city services and says people may want to check ahead to see which services are available. 	CBS46 spoke with cyber security expert Alex DeFreese and he says it's malicious software that takes over a computer or a system and encrypts it.

Cryptocurrency scams are not unheard of and initial coin offerings (ICOs) come with their own risks as well. As a result of these issues, earlier this month we reported Twitter was considering taking measures to limit or ban cryptocurrency ads to protect users from being exposed to potentially-shady ICOs or crypto scams in general.	Details were scarce at the time but it wouldn't have been an unprecedented move on Twitter's part - Facebook and Google had already made similar decisions.	Now, however, those reports have been confirmed. In statements to Reuters, Twitter confirmed their intentions to begin banning cryptocurrency advertising from their platform starting Tuesday.

45,newsfeedback@fool.com (Rex Moore),"Returns as of 4/17/2018	Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.	Returns as of 4/17/2018	Goldman Sachs says blockchain could disrupt everything.	Dr. Julian Hosp, co-founder of TenX and author of the book Cryptocurrencies Simply Explained, heartily agrees.	Yes, there's a lot of disruptive buzz around cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as the blockchain technology that enables them all. What's an investor to do?	According to Dr. Hosp, who led the ""What Is Blockchain? How Will It Change The World?"" session at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, investors need to be following this space closely. 	Admirably, the Austrian-born former trauma surgeon uses a baseball metaphor to describe the opportunity. ""We're in the first out of the first inning,"" he told the audience. ""This is the equivalent of the Internet in 1994, before the Internet exploded in 1996.""	In true Foolish fashion, he also warns that most ""internet stocks"" utterly failed after the dot-com crash -- and the majority of cryptocurrencies will suffer the same fate.	Still, the internet has created untold value for society -- and countless millionaires -- and Dr. Hosp believes most investors should start getting at least some small exposure in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.	He's especially high on the Ethereum platform, which extends far beyond cryptocurrency. Ethereum's ability to securely store data transparently, yet anonymously, means not only ""smart contracts"" for legal uses but also use cases for insurance, medical records, and even elections.	He has a few simple guidelines for investors. The upside potential is tremendous -- perhaps 50x to 100x over the next few years. But the downside? You could lose everything in the wrong investments, just like some internet companies in the 2000s. Therefore:	You can get much more knowledge from Dr. Hosp in my video interview below, including a deeper dive into how to analyze and evaluate various cyrptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs). A full transcript follows the video. 	Transcript	Rex Moore: Dr. Hosp, you had a great session; I really enjoyed it. Let's talk to investors for a moment, and talk first of all about the size of the opportunity -- the blockchain opportunity here. What kind of dollars are we talking about?	Dr. Julian Hosp: You can always lose 100%. I always want to focus, especially in this ecosystem, with the downside first. So, you can lose 100%.	At the moment the market is at around $300 billion to $400 billion -- that's the total kind of market cap. If you look at predictions, these aren't my predictions; these are predictions from the World Economic Forum, some really smart people. We can expect that blockchain as a whole, the entire market, should be going to $5 trillion or $6 trillion over the next five to seven years. 	Now, this means we have, I don't know, maybe a 50x to 100x upside and maybe a 1x downside. There is one big challenge in this, though, because if you have this possibility, then it would be a no-brainer to invest. No one knows that if those currencies that are a part of the market cap today are actually the ones that are going to pushing blockchain up to this higher valuation.	So you have to be really careful. Don't make too large bets. See this as speculative, highly speculative. But on the other hand, I also think everyone should be involved in cryptocurrency, because it is a new asset class and it behaves different from most of your asset classes, and it is definitely an investment or a speculation opportunity in that sense.	Rex Moore: What should investors be looking for? It's a pretty vast space. It's pretty varied.	Dr. Julian Hosp: I think instead of looking at the actual solution that something brings, look at the actual problem it's solving and ask yourself, is this actually a problem? Is this a real problem? Can this problem be solved with a centralized solution, or does it need a decentralized solution?	And if it really does need a decentralized solution, it might be a really good play, and it might take quite some time for it to happen, but then it might be a really good play. And I think today most people get very emotional. They don't look at fundamentals, as much as you can have fundamentals in cryptocurrencies, but you can. There are certain fundamentals; they are different to what a traditional stock investor might have for him or herself as fundamentals.	So look for those. Look for the actual use case. Look for the problem that a coin, a company, or a system is trying to solve. Ask yourself, does this make sense?	And then I think you can make sizable amounts of bets on this going up, and I think that having 10 to 15 bets...I think that's a good amount you can oversee. You can also do some due diligence and research. I think you can live with some of those not working out, and others doing really well. 	Rex Moore: And I assume you're not just talking about cryptocurrency here. What are some other areas investors can look at to get involved in this?	Dr. Julian Hosp: Cryptocurrencies, I mentioned in my keynote as well, I think it's the least exciting topic of all of them. Yes it's financials, and yes there is money to be made, but just from an executional standpoint...it's not that we don't have digital currencies. I mean, PayPal is digital, right? Yes, one is decentralized and one is centralized, but it's not the most exciting kind of thing. 	I think a big, big use case -- obviously, for example Ethereum, which has centralized computer allowing for smart contracts. Smart contracts allow you to make contracts without another human being, but it's actually enforced by this computer program.	All kinds of used cases can happen there. The use case I talked about today was insurance, which can be very interesting, I have to admit that, because I can make insurance, and it's going to be enforced no problem.	But there's also risks attached to that. What if other people start betting on my insurance and start betting on my house burning down? And since there's no one who can control this or there's no law, well, suddenly there's enough people who want my house to burn down. So that was a use case -- kind of the antagonist of this entire thing. 	I think data storage in general...I talked about medical data storage. But this can also be data storage, one thing I didn't talk about, for example voting. In the U.S. there has been this ongoing discussion about how transparent is the voting, how should it work, what should people do. Blockchain would be a really excellent solution for this. It's very transparent. Everyone can see that it's done properly. It's completely anonymous, and one doesn't have to trust anyone. You don't even have to trust the government. You just trust that system, right? It's actually a very interesting approach.	In Africa, Sierra Leone, they are now trying this out for the very first time. Obviously a third-world country, right, but obviously interesting to see where this is leading to.	Rex Moore: Now you probably haven't thought of this, but if you were an investor, how do they participate in everything you just mentioned? Are there certain companies you see that are involved?	Dr. Julian Hosp: You have two ways. You can participate in the traditional VC or angel route. There's very few companies in this space, because the space is so young, that are publicly traded. So you have to probably be an accredited investor to be able to participate on an equity kind of basis.	And then obviously you have some companies who create a token. For example, my own company TenX, we have a token (PAY) and you can participate with that token on the company's success. Now obviously there are different rules and different kind of systems as the underlying equity, but for some people this might be very interesting.	Rex Moore: Your company...what problem does TenX solve?	Dr. Julian Hosp: What we are doing is solving the problem of the usability of cryptocurrencies right now. We have something we are working long-term on, but at the moment we're really solving that these cryptocurrencies like bitcoin or ether or dash are actually not really usable.	Yes they are there, but how do you go to a gas station or Starbucks and actually use your Bitcoin? You can't. So what we do is we have a debit card system where you can connect bitcoin, ether, dash tokens, and so on with this debit card, and then you can just go there and use your cryptocurrencies there.	The major use case obviously is -- maybe in the U.S. a little bit because I understand most in America will have a credit card, many people have -- but there are a lot of people all around the world that don't have access to a bank account, don't have access to a credit card. So we have a lot of these people actually asking.	And then obviously people who are investors in cryptocurrencies, and they want to stay very liquid and very flexible and say, ""I don't want to go to an exchange and swap my coins there. This takes time until I have my money out."" It's just, I have my card from TenX, I can go to any store and just spend my coins. So if the coin's going up, great point in spending them right now.	Long-term, and I really want to point this out, long-term it's really about moving value between point A and point B, and right now this is what a traditional system, fiat...one thing we're developing is something called COMIT, where it's really about connecting cryptocurrencies, connecting blockchains, and shifting value, moving value back and forth between there.	Because the major problem that I see coming up is that we have all these blockchains almost like silos; how are they communicating with each other? This is going to be really exciting once one blockchain can communicate to the next one. There's no person that's responsible for this, so you need to create protocols. These protocols are going to be worth a lot. The highways are going to be worth a lot. So that's what we're really working on on a mid- to long-term basis.	The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

46,newsfeedback@fool.com (Rex Moore),"Returns as of 4/17/2018	Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.	Returns as of 4/17/2018	Goldman Sachs says blockchain could disrupt everything.	Dr. Julian Hosp, co-founder of TenX and author of the book Cryptocurrencies Simply Explained, heartily agrees.	Yes, there's a lot of disruptive buzz around cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, as well as the blockchain technology that enables them all. What's an investor to do?	According to Dr. Hosp, who led the ""What Is Blockchain? How Will It Change The World?"" session at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, investors need to be following this space closely. 	Admirably, the Austrian-born former trauma surgeon uses a baseball metaphor to describe the opportunity. ""We're in the first out of the first inning,"" he told the audience. ""This is the equivalent of the Internet in 1994, before the Internet exploded in 1996.""	In true Foolish fashion, he also warns that most ""internet stocks"" utterly failed after the dot-com crash -- and the majority of cryptocurrencies will suffer the same fate.	Still, the internet has created untold value for society -- and countless millionaires -- and Dr. Hosp believes most investors should start getting at least some small exposure in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.	He's especially high on the Ethereum platform, which extends far beyond cryptocurrency. Ethereum's ability to securely store data transparently, yet anonymously, means not only ""smart contracts"" for legal uses but also use cases for insurance, medical records, and even elections.	He has a few simple guidelines for investors. The upside potential is tremendous -- perhaps 50x to 100x over the next few years. But the downside?

	The blockchain community is taking control of its narrative with Netflix Inc. bankrolling the “Hardfork” mini-series, a sci-fi thriller about the power of decentralization and how it can disrupt authoritarian role. Blockchain industry veteran, film producer, YouTube celebrity, and host of BlockChain Unbound Naomi Brockwell (pictured) is a part of the project as a producer and actor.	“To create a series that could potentially expose people to this technology for the first time and to have control of [the blockchain] narrative is exciting,” said Brockwell, speaking with John Furrier (@furrier), host of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s mobile livestreaming studio, at the BlockChain Unbound event in San Juan, Puerto Rico.	Along with “Hardfork” and disrupting mainstream media, topics covered in the interview included the true nature of the blockchain community, John Oliver’s “Last Night Tonight Bitcoin” segment, and the importance of old school pen and paper for keeping your crypto-currency secure.	“Blockchain was invented as a tool for giving people more freedom, and what you’re seeing now is a bunch of people who entered the space who don’t necessarily share that ethos,” Brockwell said.	What she loves about blockchain is that regardless of the intent of businesses that are adopting the technology, the end result will be a more decentralized free society. “When you decentralize any power structure, no matter what industry it is, you’re really making people more free; you’re giving them more responsibility, and I like seeing things become decentralized,” Brockwell sated.	John Oliver of HBO’s “Late Night Tonight” recently aired a segment on bitcoin that resulted in entrepreneur and venture capitalist Brock Pierce parting ways with Block One Capital Inc., developer of the blockchain platform EOS.	“How does one person have that power?” asked Furrier, who saw the incident as an example of “where blockchain can disrupt the media.”	According to Brockwell, “Since its inception, you’ve seen people in media and mainstream media in particular target [cryptocurrency], and they’re just adopting the government narrative saying, ‘Oh, everyone in this industry is corrupt.’ … You know what, you can do some research and do a bit better than that,” she concluded.

		Twitter became the latest internet platform to ban ads for cryptocurrency offerings, saying these services are often associated with ""deception and fraud""	Twitter on Monday announced a ban on ads for initial offerings of cryptocurrency or sales of virtual currency tokens, sending the value of bitcoin diving below $8,000.	Twitter followed the lead of Google and Facebook, which earlier this year cracked down on digital currency ads to protect users from being duped.	""We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community,"" Twitter said in a statement.	""As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency.""	Under the new policy, the advertisement of ICOs, or initial currency offerings, and token sales will be prohibited at the global one-to-many messaging platform.	Some startups have used ICOs to raise billions of dollars in a highly volatile, unregulated market.	Twitter said: ""We know that this type of content is often associated with deception and fraud, both organic and paid, and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner.""	The value of bitcoin dropped eight percent to $7,929 after the Twitter ad ban was announced, according to market data from Bloomberg.	The new policy leaves open the door for ads for cryptocurrency exchanges or secure ""wallet"" services offered by public companies listed on some major exchanges.	Twitter plans to modify its ad policy as the digital currency market evolves and its ability to distinguish dubious marketing messages improves.	The British government early this year called for global regulation of controversial virtual currency bitcoin, adding that the G20 would address the topic this month.	Bitcoin is independent of governments and banks and uses blockchain technology, where encrypted digital coins are created by supercomputers.	The virtual currency is not regulated by any central bank but is instead overseen by a community of users who try to guard against counterfeiting.	Virtual currency exchanges have seen tremendous volatility, and have sparked concerns they can be used to launder money for criminal networks.	The value of Litecoin also tanked on Monday, after the Singapore-based nonprofit Litecoin foundation put out word that payments processor LitePay ceased operations.	LitePay had asked the foundation for more funding, but was ""unable to provide a satisfactory picture"" of what it did with the money it had already been given, according to a release.	""We are greatly disheartened that this saga has ended in this way and we apologize for not doing enough due diligence that could have uncovered some of these issues earlier,"" Litecoin foundation said in the release.	""We are currently working hard to tighten our due diligence practices and ensure that this does not happen again.""	Litecoin was down about 10 percent to $144.05 as of mid-day.	Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

49,"newsfeedback@fool.com (Demitrios Kalogeropoulos, Rich Duprey, and Jeremy Bowman)","Returns as of 4/17/2018	Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.	Returns as of 4/17/2018	There are many good reasons to be cautious if you're thinking about an investment in bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is highly volatile, for one, and its long-term usefulness as a virtual currency is still an open question.	You can find far less risky investment opportunities among individual stocks, whose returns ultimately depend on more predictable metrics like sales growth and profitability.	Below, Motley Fool investors highlight three such options that look attractive right now. Read on to see why you might want to consider picking up shares of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), or Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) before shelling out for bitcoin.	Image source: Getty Images.	Jeremy Bowman (Facebook): Bitcoin investors are no strangers to controversy. The popular cryptocurrency has been a hot topic of debate among investors, economists, and regulators in recent years, amid speculation over whether bitcoin will ever become a widely used currency.	In the stock market, Facebook has recently courted a whirlwind of controversy due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which has pushed the stock down more than 10%. However, the actual fallout from the complicated incident is unclear, and I think the sell-off sets up a buying opportunity.	The uproar over Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook data could lead to increased scrutiny from regulators, but it's unlikely to affect the behavior of many Facebook users; they spend on average 50 minutes per day on the company's properties, which include Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.	The company's network effects are incredibly strong. There is simply no adequate substitute for its platforms that would allow users to readily share life updates, photos, messages, invitations, and news items, among other things. And that set of network effects has built a wide economic moat with operating margin near 50%, meaning Facebook can easily afford to make any adjustments that regulators may impose.	Now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.6, the stock is cheaper than it's ever been. And the company still has a number of promising growth avenues ahead, including international users, Instagram, and its messaging apps. If you think that Facebook users will soon forget about the latest scandal once the news cycle moves on, now looks like a great time to buy.	Rich Duprey (Roku): Shares of online-streaming device maker Roku may not be as discounted as the value of bitcoin these days. But with their depressed price, and Roku's future growth opportunities, the stock is a better buy than the cryptocurrency.	Image source: Getty Images.	While Roku's hardware segment remains the biggest source of revenue, it's the content platform that is growing fastest -- and offers the best opportunities for taking the streaming-video service to the next level and beyond.	Roku just announced that its Roku Channel will appear on smart TVs from Samsung. This will be the first time Roku's ad-supported content can be seen on something other than a Roku device. It also points the way to how the service will be using its vast content library to challenge both Netflix and Amazon.com: no easy task, to be sure, and it may require Roku to eventually get into producing original content like its rivals do. But Roku's devices have the largest market share, with a 37% installed base, and it's one of only two streaming-media services that saw its share increase.	Roku is still losing money at the moment. But its platform segment is vastly more profitable than hardware, with gross margins in excess of 74% -- so continuing to monetize the asset should get it into the black fairly quickly, and ought to catapult its stock higher. There seems a lot less risk involved in betting on this streaming-media company than on the direction bitcoin's value is going to take.	Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Starbucks): Starbucks stock has created many millionaires since its 1992 initial public offering, but that success hasn't attracted anything like the media attention that bitcoin's volatility has drawn. Yet if I had to bet on which investment can beat the market from here, it wouldn't be a close call.	Image source: Getty Images.	Sure, Starbucks is struggling with unusually weak growth in its core U.S. market. Poor merchandising over the holiday season might mean the retailer will land just shy of management's sales targets for the second straight year, too.	But the coffee titan has no shortage of expansion opportunities. It is opening stores in China at a rate of one every 15 hours, with 1,800 new locations set to launch between now and 2021. The U.S. segment stands to benefit from rising food sales, which recently hit a new record for Starbucks at 21% of the business. There's also a big opportunity to drive afternoon traffic with new iced and cold-brew drinks.	Even if a growth rebound takes longer than expected at Starbucks, investors can feel confident in riding out volatility while owning this highly profitable market leader. You can't say the same thing about the value of a bitcoin holding.		John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

51,Kimberly Chin," 	AMD's heyday as the chip of choice for Ethereum miners is about to come to an end, warns a Susquehanna analyst.	The advent of a new application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) — a graphics chip used to mine Ethereum — developed by Chinese-based chipmaker Bitmain spells trouble for AMD because the increased competition threatens its market share.	""While this call is likely early (in front of needed GPU channel replenishment), the proliferation of Ethereum mining ASICs have the ability to impact ~20% of AMD's total company revenue,"" wrote Christopher Rolland, a Susquehanna analyst. 	AMD's total revenue exposure to GPU sales makes it especially vulnerable to competition, Rolland notes.	""While Bitmain is likely to be the largest ASIC vendor (currently 70-80% of Bitcoin mining ASICs) and the first to market with this product, we have learned of at least three other companies working on Ethereum ASICs, all at various stages of development,"" Rolland said.	Though the popularity and price of cryptocurrencies has fallen since their December highs, demand for graphics cards that help users mine Ethereum, bitcoin, and other digital currencies has risen, sparking a rise in prices for the sought-after chips, as well as shortages. 	Rolland still believes that AMD will have a ""blow out"" first quarter of 2018, bringing in $500 million in revenues. However, he believes as new chips come into market, AMD will feel the pressure.	He downgraded AMD shares to ""Negative"" and shifted his price target to $7.50 per share from $13.	The analyst also warned that Nvidia is subject to similar pressures, but it does not have the same fate. Nvidia has less revenue exposure to Ethereum-related GPU sales, Rolland said, adding Nvidia has a ""stronger more durable gaming franchise which would help it work through this potential Ethereum-related unwind.""	Though he did not change his rating on Nvidia, he did lower its price target to $200 a share from $215.

54,Lucinda Shen,"Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey’s belief in Bitcoin doesn’t seem to extend to all crypto. At least for now.	Joining Google parent company Alphabet and Facebook, Twitter revealed Monday its plans to ban some cryptocurrency-related ads in a bid to decrease fraud and deception on the site. Namely, the social media company plans to prohibit initial coin offerings and token sales, and it plans to only show ads of exchanges or wallets provided by companies listed on major stock exchanges.	Curiously, that would bar firms such as the largest U.S.-based exchange Coinbase from advertising on the platform, while presumably still allowing Twitter’s sister company, Square, to advertise its young Bitcoin buying and selling function on its Cash app.	And that’s where the differences come in. Google made no such provision regarding exchanges or wallets by publicly traded companies in its version of the ban, saying it would bar ads of ICOs, trading advice, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency exchanges. Facebook also bans ads promoting cryptocurrency exchanges, a spokesperson told Fortune, making no distinction between those backed by private, or public firms.	There is a logic to focusing on exchanges from public firms. Companies on a major stock exchange are often subject to tougher transparency rules, giving more insight into the workings of a company they are putting their faith in.	The ban will roll out Tuesday, and become fully enforceable for all advertisers within a month.	“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally,” a Twitter spokesperson said. “We will continue to iterate and improve upon this policy as the industry evolves.”	The change for Twitter, meanwhile, comes amid comments from Dorsey that the poster child of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, will be the world’s universal currency in 10 years or so.	Still, the self regulation for social media giants likely won’t stop there. Aside from ads, social media firms like Twitter will have the difficult task of addressing fake cryptocurrency news on their own platforms. And in a space as young as this, there is no shortage. Earlier this year, an account claiming to be Elon Musk, for instance, managed scamming users out of thousands of dollars worth of Ethereum. Last year, news that Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had died led to a brief crash—only for investors to find that the news was false. In January, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee found the need to warn follows away from an an account pretending to be none other than Lee himself.	On the same day as Twitter’s new ban, the price of Bitcoin fell 6% to $7,950.",With one interesting exception.,Fortune,http://fortune.com/2018/03/26/twitter-square-cryptocurrency-ban-bitcoin-price/,2018-03-26 20:12:43+00:00,"Twitter, Backed by Bitcoin Fan Jack Dorsey, to Bar Some Cryptocurrency Ads Starting Tuesday"
55,The Sovereign Investor,"Earlier this month, cryptocurrency traders gathered in Manhattan.	One attendee later observed that “they looked a little shell-shocked.”	Get the entire 10-part series on Timeless Reading in PDF. Save it to your desktop, read it on your tablet, or email to your colleagues.	See 2017 Hedge Fund Letters.	As well they might.	Last year’s booming crypto market made many of them millionaires. Bitcoin’s price rose more than 1,500% last year … before diving 44% so far this year.	But that’s not the reason many attendees had the thousand-yard-stare.	They were worried about the IRS.	You see, many of them had sold bitcoin in December to lock in profits. They’d used the proceeds to buy new cryptocurrencies with steeper price trend lines. Those newer crypto assets, however, had suffered steep losses in 2018.	So now the traders lacked the dollars to pay the IRS for their 2017 capital gains on bitcoin. Some of those tax bills ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.	Sadly, the IRS doesn’t accept bitcoin. And it doesn’t take “oops” as an excuse … even in the exciting new world of virtual money.	Crypto Assets? Exactly.	In January, I interviewed our own Ian King for my Bauman Unplugged monthly podcast. Ian and I discussed the concept of “crypto assets,” and why that’s a more useful term than “cryptocurrency.”	The IRS agrees with us: Current tax rules treat cryptocurrency as an asset rather than a currency.	That means every time you sell or transfer a digital coin for something else — dollars, another cryptocurrency or a slice of pizza — you’re creating a taxable event involving capital gains or losses.	Let’s say you acquired $100,000 in bitcoin in January 2017. By December, it would have been worth around $1.5 million. You then sold $1 million worth of bitcoin for dollars and invested it in some other hot initial coin offering.	That big windfall gain put you into the top tax bracket, so you’d owe the IRS almost $370,000 in capital gains taxes.	You’d owe the same amount even if you’d used $1 million in bitcoin to buy gold, a car or a house. The value of bitcoin had increased, and you realized that gain when you converted it to another form, triggering a taxable event.	At least the tax on a one-off event like that would be easy to calculate.	Imagine you had traded bitcoin hundreds of times last year, both for speculation and to buy stuff. Every single transaction must be accounted for as a short-term capital gain or loss … and reported on your 2017 tax return.	Virtual Money, Real Laws 	Most of the attendees at the Manhattan event admitted that most traders had never paid taxes on their crypto gains and weren’t planning to start.	After all, Satoshi Nakamoto invented bitcoin to create a government-free financial space. And the blockchain is anonymous, right? How’s the IRS gonna know?	Turns out, it’s not difficult to find out.	In 2013, the IRS formed a team to study the use of virtual currencies to avoid taxes. Over the next two years, the team prepared a case seeking the identities of all U.S. customers of Coinbase from 2013 to 2015. Eventually the IRS narrowed that down to 14,000 customers who had made trades of $20,000 or more.	In its filing, the IRS noted that although Coinbase boasts nearly six million customers, fewer than 1,000 U.S. taxpayers have ever reported cryptocurrency gains to the agency.	On November 29 last year, a federal judge ruled that Coinbase must turn over those users’ names, birth dates, addresses and taxpayer IDs, along with records of all account activity.	For those folks, the crypto-party is over. They face a future of interest charges, penalties and audits.	Crypto and Tax: What You Need to Know	If you’ve ever traded in a cryptocurrency, tack this summary up on the wall as a reminder of what you need to do before April 15.	No One Said It Would Be Easy	In all the excitement about crypto assets, it’s easy to overlook the fact that they’re the centerpiece of a political struggle. You should expect aggressive tax enforcement in the crypto space to be part of this ongoing struggle.	Many people like cryptocurrencies because they promise an escape from government control. Governments know this and are fighting back. The pace of government action in the crypto space has increased dramatically since the beginning of this year.	However, most of us invest in crypto assets because they’re potentially profitable. You may not be interested in politics. Unfortunately, politics are interested in you.	Forewarned is forearmed.

The analyst expects NVIDIA and AMD to also take some hits in share prices, with AMD the worst affected by his claims.	 	The price target of AMD shares that Rolland has is $7.50, dropping down from $13 which is a massive 29% drop while NVIDIA would drop from $215 to $200, less than 10%. The reason why NVIDIA would survive through an Ethereum ASIC miner dominanted world is that NVIDIA has a far stronger stack of GeForce GTX graphics cards for gamers, while Radeon RX Vega wasn't enough to beat the GTX 1080 Ti. The Radeon RX 500 series is strong up to 1080/1440p, but beyond that AMD is left in the dust by NVIDIA.","We've been hearing rumbles of an Ethereum ASIC miner, something that seems to be right around the corner... eyeing off a release in the next couple of months at the latest.

57,Rick D.,"-Bitcoin news, price, information & analysis	The global social media platform Twitter has announced today that it will no longer allow advertising for certain cryptocurrency products and services. The news follows similar moves from other internet giants Google and Facebook. The hope is that such bans will help to protect vulnerable investors from deceptive campaigns by fraudulent companies.	According to a report on Reuters, the ban will come into effect starting on Tuesday. It will cover most but not all cryptocurrency-related products and services. These will include initial coin offerings (ICOs), cryptocurrency wallet services, and many digital asset exchange platforms.	A spokesperson for Twitter told CNBC:	“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency… Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally.”	The news confirms rumours that circulated earlier this month that Twitter would follow the likes of Facebook and Google in their banning cryptocurrency ads. During the beginning of March, Google updated their financial services policy to include restrictions on digital currency promotion. These measures will come into effect in June. Meanwhile, Facebook announced their initiative against the advertising of fraudulent crypto products and services in late January.	When the Twitter ban was first hinted at, CNBC report that Bitcoin prices fell sharply. They recovered most of that drop in a matter of hours though. However, not everyone sees the news about the advertising restrictions as important to the price of BTC. Brian Kelly, CEO of BKCM, a prominent digital asset investment fund told the publication that the market was “just drifting lower” and the news wasn’t really anything to concern investors in Bitcoin. For him:	“… the biggest potential short-term catalyst is increased trading in South Korea as that government re-embraces crypto.”	Whilst Jack Dorsey’s platform is publicly declaring war on fraudulent cryptocurrency-related schemes, the Twitter CEO is continuous in his support of the world’s most popular digital asset – Bitcoin.	As CEO of Square, the entrepreneur recently launched BTC buying and selling options on his company’s Cash App. In addition, he has contributed personal funds towards the development of the Bitcoin scaling solution known as Lightning Network. He was amongst a group who contributed $2.5 million to improving the software upgrade that went live on the Bitcoin main net earlier this month.	Finally, the main man at Twitter also made the particularly brash claim that Bitcoin will eventually emerge as a single currency for the entire planet. With less money following bogus products, perhaps such bans will be favourable for Bitcoin’s market dominance going forwards.	Get the latest news delivered to your inbox.

58,Scott Scanlon,"Multiple security firms recently identified cryptocurrency mining service Coinhive as the top malicious threat to Web users, thanks to the tendency for Coinhive’s computer code to be used on hacked Web sites to steal the processing power of its visitors’ devices. This post looks at how Coinhive vaulted to the top of the threat list less than a year after its debut, and explores clues about the possible identities of the individuals behind the service.	 Coinhive is a cryptocurrency mining service that relies on a small chunk of computer code designed to be installed on Web sites. The code uses some or all of the computing power of any browser that visits the site in question, enlisting the machine in a bid to mine bits of the Monero cryptocurrency.	 Monero differs from Bitcoin in that its transactions are virtually untraceble, and there is no way for an outsider to track Monero transactions between two parties. Naturally, this quality makes Monero an especially appealing choice for cybercriminals.	 Coinhive released its mining code last summer, pitching it as a way for Web site owners to earn an income without running intrusive or annoying advertisements. But since then, Coinhive’s code has emerged as the top malware threat tracked by multiple security firms. That’s because much of the time the code is installed on hacked Web sites — without the owner’s knowledge or permission.	 Much like a malware infection by a malicious bot or Trojan, Coinhive’s code frequently locks up a user’s browser and drains the device’s battery as it continues to mine Monero for as long a visitor is browsing the site. According to publicwww.com, a service that indexes the source code of Web sites, there are nearly 32,000 Web sites currently running Coinhive’s JavaScript miner code.

	March 26, 2018: Markets opened higher Monday and following a mid-day dip seem bound for a solid gain on the day. The primary mover appears to have been reports that the United States and China are talking about how to dodge a global trade war. In company news, Facebook continues to get battered over its handling of personal information, but the rest of the tech sector was flying.	WTI crude oil for May delivery settled at $65.55 a barrel, down 0.5% for the day. April gold added about 0.4% on the day to settle at $1,355.00. Equities were headed for a higher close about 10 minutes before the bell as the Dow traded up 2.77% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 2.57%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 2.95%.	Bitcoin futures (XBTJ8) for April delivery traded at $7,940, down about 7.7% on the CBOE after opening at $8,690 this morning. The digital currency’s trading range for the day was $7,850 to $11,790.	The Dow stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Monday was Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) which traded up 7.38% at $93.61. The stock’s 52-week range is $64.35 to $97.24. Volume was more than 30% above the daily average of around 31 million.

	Twitter is joining Facebook and Google in banning advertisements for initial coin offerings and token sales on its social-media platform.	""Advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally,"" a Twitter representative said in an emailed statement Monday. ""We know that this type of content is often associated with deception and fraud, both organic and paid, and are proactively implementing a number of signals to prevent these types of accounts from engaging with others in a deceptive manner.""	The decision comes after Facebook banned cryptocurrency ads in January and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said it would ban such ads starting in June, as part of a broader effort to crack down on deceptive and misleading advertising on their platforms. Social-media platforms are keeping cryptos away as regulators cast an increasingly wary eye on the sector globally.	The Securities and Exchange Commission sent a number of subpoenas earlier this month to ICO teams it suspects are breaking securities regulations, and it has warned since July that some of the offerings may be breaking securities regulations. Twitter said on March 7 that it was implementing measures to prevent crypto scams.	Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet services ads will be limited to those that are provided by a public company listed on major stock markets, and in Japan, these will be limited to crypto exchanges regulated by the nation's Financial Services Agency, the Twitter spokesperson said.	Crypto ad bans on major social-media platforms has weighed on the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin is sliding 6 percent today, approaching the $8,000 level, and is down more than 50 percent from an all time high of almost $20,000 in December.	Paid search sends less than one percent of traffic to cryptocurrency exchange sites, so the effect of crypto ad bans may be limited, according to research by website SimilarWeb, published Monday.	-- Bloomberg News

63,Bloomberg News,"This section was produced by the editorial department. The client was not given the opportunity to put restrictions on the content or review it prior to publication.	March 26, 20183:45 PM EDT	Last UpdatedApril 9, 20182:39 PM EDT	It’s one of the more unusual deals in the art world. After more than a decade, an Alberta businessman has finally found a buyer for his prized collection of gold castings of Nelson Mandela’s hand. The final price? Ten million dollars — in Bitcoin.	Attempts by Malcolm Duncan, formerly of South Africa, to sell the hands back in 2007 were scuppered by controversy over provenance and a possible missing charitable donation. This time he’s had better luck, albeit with an unusual buyer.	Little information is available about Arbitrade, an Ontario-based cryptocurrency company, something Chairman Len Schutzman says is about to change.	The company is “weeks away” from doing an initial coin offering and is building a facility in Waterloo, Ontario, to mine its own cryptocurrencies and plans to trade others. Its key selling point, he says, is that it will back all its virtual coins with some percentage of physical metal — including gold.	Nelson Mandela’s solid gold hand would seem to fit the bill, although as a general rule Schutzman says he’ll seek to acquire gold bars or coins rather than art. Weighing 20 pounds, the value of the gold is a fraction of the artifacts’ purchase price. Their real value is one of publicity, as a means of educating millennials about Mandela — and Arbitrade — through a global “Golden Hands of Nelson Mandela” tour the company plans to launch, he said.	The hands aren’t the first examples of “Mandela Art” to prove tricky to buyers and sellers. After the anti-apartheid revolutionary was released from prison, thousands of pieces of art bearing his name began flooding the market. Various scandals, including allegations of forgery, put a stop to the deluge.	Under Mandela’s own orders, many works were destroyed and the subject remains a touchy one in South Africa to this day. Duncan believes he owns the only four surviving casts of Mandela’s hand, palm and fist, tucked into bespoke imbuia wood boxes. “He cut his thumb quite badly on Robben Island, his right thumb, and you can see it,” Duncan said.	Photographs show Mandela sitting for the castings, which were made by a defunct division of Harmony Gold Mining Co. in 2002. As a condition of being allowed to buy the artifacts, Duncan says he paid double the 1.8 million-rand purchase price with the understanding Harmony would give half to Mandela’s charities. Whether that happened remains unclear.	Harmony has “supplied Mr. Duncan with the necessary paperwork verifying the provenance as requested by his attorneys,” Harmony Investor Relations Manager Lauren Fourie said by email, declining to comment when asked about the status of the donation.	So far, Duncan has been paid a Bitcoin deposit that has been converted to US$50,000. The rest is due to be delivered in quarterly installments of at least US$2 million per extremity, starting April 30.	“They take possession when I have the dollar amount in the bank,” says Duncan, who has insisted Arbitrade guarantee the value in U.S. dollars, and handle the conversion. “At two-and-a-quarter million at a time, they take one hand at a time.”	Bloomberg.com	","Crypto company Arbitrade is 'weeks away' from doing an initial coin offering and is building a facility in Waterloo, Ontario",Financial Post,http://business.financialpost.com/technology/blockchain/gold-casts-of-nelson-mandelas-hands-sell-to-ontario-cryptocurrency-company-for-10-million-in-bitcoin,2018-03-26 19:45:57+00:00,Gold casts of Nelson Mandela’s hands sell to Ontario cryptocurrency company for $10 million in Bitcoin
64,"Jordan Pearson, Emanuel Maiberg","Jordan Pearson	Image: Shutterstock	 On Monday Twitter confirmed to multiple outlets that the social network will ban some advertisements for cryptocurrencies and related products in the next 30 days. 	 After Reddit, Facebook, and finally Google all banned cryptocurrency advertising, rumors circulated last week that Twitter—a hub for the cryptocurrency community, and a cesspool of scammers—would follow suit with a ban. As the world waited for the social network to make its move, CEO Jack Dorsey said in an interview that Bitcoin will one day be a “single currency” for the world and the internet. 	 Apparently, global domination won’t require web ads. Twitter spokespeople confirmed to The Verge on Monday that the social network will ban all ads for cryptocurrency token sales and Initial Coin Offerings, largely unregulated crowdsales in which startups sell investors digital tokens in exchange for funds, usually to develop a platform for the tokens to be used on; sometimes, the promise of a platform is mostly a way to justify selling tokens that only become valuable once people buy them. 	 According to the Financial Times, the Twitter ban will also cover cryptocurrency exchanges—where virtual currencies and tokens are bought and sold—and wallet services. This choice follows Google and Facebook in banning cryptocurrency services that are not necessarily scams or even untoward, but are associated with an industry that has a whole lot of that going on all the time.   	 With Twitter joining its Silicon Valley peers, most of the major social networks and ad platforms on the web have now banned cryptocurrency ads. It remains to be seen how this will affect the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Zcash, or Monero, for example—virtual currencies that arguably don’t need advertising—versus tokens that launch with a crowd sale. 	 Maybe if a cryptocurrency or token needs a heavy marketing campaign, at this point, it’s not worth having around in the first place. 	Sign up for Motherboard Premium.

	It is not like some high volatile investments crash and burn just as fast as they had skyrocketed.	They're not investing - they are speculating (gambling).	And they and many folks who buy stocks do not understand the relationship between risk and return.	With all these years of too cheap money, speculating fever is in all asset classes and it never ends well.	And what these kids don't seem to realize is that when they lose, they are on the hook for a student loan that they will be stuck with.  The only way to get out of paying a student loan is to die.	Perhaps they opened a wallet and funded it so they could buy something with Bitcoin.	That's an 'investment', yes, but not so simple as an Investment...	*whoosh*	Most countries will fund tertiary education for their own citizens.	Foreigners get charged the full rate, to stop people trying to do precisely what you suggest.	
Some countries will fund college education, for their citizens that:
	
Made good grades in high school.

Continue to make good progress towards a meaningful degree.
	
No nations fund school for all, trade school perhaps.	Germany,France,Finland,Sweden,Norway,Argentina,Iceland,Denmark,Brazil,Turkey,Scotland,Greece,Austria,Belgium(Results from just a few minutes and Duck. Some of these countries have small fees but none of them require ""progress"".)	
Nonsense.
	
If you aren't making grades and progress towards your degree in Germany, you are bouncing down the stairs of the university. You obviously phrased your search in a stupid way.	New York, London, Paris, Munich.Everybody talk about pop muzik.		Most countries will fund tertiary education for their own citizens.	Care to check on your definition of ""most""? I think you mean ""European"".		whose government is immune to corruption, and actually values their citizens	Surely you jest.		The only way to get out of paying a student loan is to die.	This is not true.  Emigrating usually works too.	'Never' is a long time. Kind of difficult if you get a job at a company and they need to send you on a business trip to the US. Or even a business trip that transits the US.		'Never' is a long time. Kind of difficult if you get a job at a company and they need to send you on a business trip to the US. Or even a business trip that transits the US.	Not paying your student loan isn't under the criminal code, so cops won't run to a judge to get an arrest warrant if you show up.		But taking out debt without ever intending to pay it is known as fraud.	People may have the best of intentions when taking out a loan.  In which case they're only defaulting, which is not something that normally warrants a criminal arrest or extradition.	I was thinking about those emigrating, not those not immigrating.People who emigrate sometimes find that economical obligations they have in their old country no longer are enforceable.  Outstanding fines and taxes are sometimes covered by agreements between countries, but things like student loans are unlikely to be.		The only way to get out of paying a student loan is to die.	
Unless your parents (or someone else) co-signed it ... After daughter’s death, parents plead for forgiveness of her $200K student-loan debt [today.com], then they're stuck with it. (Probably not surprising, but worth mentioning.)	They were probably expecting her to live and pay it pack. Takeaway I get from this is to have all signers on a loan to take out life insurance that you can access in the event of their death. Should be an option on the loan.	Some things never change. I remember back in 1992, there was a dude in our dorm who bet his student loan on the new at the time sports lottery. I think that he bet on hockey games. He got called Pete Rose for a year for that dumb move.	Yup. Americans need to hit their children. Hard. Then youth does not engender the invincibility syndrome.	This is unrelated to other assorted stupidities of youth.	College debt is the hardest debt to discharge in bankruptcy.  If you're taking a highly speculative position at that point in your life, you're better off running up credit card debt.  Either you can pay it off with interest, or you have a bankruptcy before you graduate. Neither will result in 30-year-old you screwed cause of a bad bet.	
College is a highly-speculative position.  It's part of why some of us are advocating for apprenticeship and trade school programs as well as just college access.  The Democratic party has sort of built a narrative where you go to college and you're a winner, or you don't go to college and you're a loser; it doesn't work like that.	
College educations require several years of time investment.  Full-time college requires large amounts of attention and takes a toll on your capacity to work, which means you're 	Technically true, but it's not like you can get a loan from the IRS to buy BitCoin, and students don't normally owe the IRS anything.		Technically true, but it's not like you can get a loan from the IRS to buy BitCoin, and students don't normally owe the IRS anything.	It's simple, instead of setting aside income that would normally go on something like a 1099-MISC, you invest it. (or gamble it). That's technically the IRS's money. It's harder to do with a W-2 because your employer normally takes your estimated taxes out for you. But I suppose you could make up a goofy estimate and borrow money from the IRS that way too.	DISCLAIMER: I do not advocate tax fraud. The IRS will probably find you and try to ruin your life.	I hope these aren't the same students asking for debt forgiveness.	I could very well believe that these are the same students asking for debt forgiveness and they'd be right. If you hear how many people have to work a large part of their lives to repay their student dept then students investing in cryptocurrency sounds a lot like a desperate gamble to get out of a deep hole.	The whole description of getting a loan  ""Student loans arenâ(TM)t just for buying textbooks, No. 2 pencils, and apples for bribing teachers anymore. "" is ridiculous.	I think this is right.  The worse the loan terms are, the more desperate the borrower will be to eliminate the debt.	But to be honest, I bet there's a non-zero percentage of people looking at this as a great source of speculation capital on something that looks no-lose.	The whole student loan situation is a total mess.  The universities push up tuition and expand their bureaucratic fiefdoms, dorms become luxury condos, and idiot students self-indulge in luxury living.	Meanwhile, all this debt accrues and its i 	Your post is 100% spot on insightful; and those chickens will come home to roost at some point.	I'm not a libertarian by any stretch of the imagination; but the student loan situation is one thing they're right about.	What does that chart even show?  The Y axis is just labelled ""percent"".
	Anyway, if you're studying art in college because you're looking for a financial ROI, you're probably going to be disappointed, but I'm not sure that's why people study those things.
	If the ""financial value"" of your education drops to zero, at least you still have the education.  If the price of bitcoin drops to zero (which is far from unthinkable), you've got jack squat.

Green bud was the bribe of choice.	I really would like to see these students' application essays.  They don't sound like the brightest bulbs.	Also, can we please just make college free so banks can't continue to be loan sharks to young people?  I mean, what the fuck.  Kids are coming out of school with six-figure debt.

It was part of Obamacare and the interest in the loans is a large part of how they passed Obamacare like they did.	Not being able to discharge student loans happened when the government began backing the loans.  It wasn't the banks demanding this, it was the Federal government.	Further, it's a bunch of private universities who really target kids with crazy sales tactics like; ""You've won a scholarship. We will cover $35,000 or your $55,000 tuition costs per term. "" Meanwhile, the local state university is about $5,000/term. Banks have almost not blame in this mess.	Banks have almost not blame in this mess.	Banks in general are risk-averse, and student loans are pulling at all the red flags that any lender would use to signal a risky loan.	Things like:* No credit history (they're coming out of high school and few probably got a credit card to build up a credit history)* A big loan (6 figure sum!)* No assets to speak of (teens, again)* No assets to speak of even after purchase (i.e., you're not buying an asset with the loan)* No steady employment* Delayed payback	Knowing all that, would you loan someone $100,000+? Even a mortgage means the bank has something to secure the loan.	It's why the government has to tilt things so it isn't so risky on banks - such as non-dischargable, guarantees on repayment, etc.	Banks aren't stupid. Student loans are structured the way they are because no financial institution is stupid enough to make such loans unassisted.	The insurance against risky mortgages is the house.  You don't pay, they get the house.  Student loans are unsecured.  You did know that, didn't you?	 Think about it. When you throw limitless dollars at a limited amount of goods / services, what happens? Prices rise - rapidly. That's what's happened in higher education over the past several decades. Stop backing the loans, and the price will fall. It's Econ 101.	Stop requiring the loans and the price will fall even further.  The reason tuitions have gone up is because we have this stupid system where the government guarantees loans so the universities know there's money to be made.	Instead of lending money 	That's insane. Why should I pay for someone else to go to school?	Why should I pay for the roads you use?  Why should I pay for the military to protect you?  Why should anyone pay more for a product than what it cost to make?  Why should a dime of money go to someone's profit just for owning a share of stock and having nothing to do with the products?	All these are questions that you will be better equipped to answer when you get out of middle school.	Especially if they're majoring in *any* of the ""let's invent new gender identities"" majors.	I'm used to working with grants and government loans. Typically, you at the end don't actually see the money, you get to distribute money from the fund provided and have to give a pretty good accounting.	Stuff like meals and lodging are scrutinized and only permitted to a certain extent, so how do students get this 'free money' to ""live off"" in school so they can spend it on frivolous stuff? Back in my day, we used to have this thing called ""a job"" and you worked at it vacations, weekends and nights to get food. It's a 30 year loan at like 4-5%, that's almost as good a a mortgage.	The article is nonsense. You can't buy crypocurrency with a student loan. You buy things with money. Saying this money was student loan and the money you spent on spring break was from Daddy is absurd. It's all one pool of available funds, trying to compartment it into this money and that money will get you into trouble every time.	If you1) Had no job2) Received thousands of dollars in student loans3) Spent thousands of dollars on cryptocurrency.	Then, yes, you bought cryptocurrency using your student loans.  Or are you saying if the loans hadn't been approved the students would have dropped out of college but continued to pay for the cryptocurrency?  Whether or not it's provable to a degree of legal certainly, it's pretty obvious that the function of the loan was to enable the purchase of the currency.	What I meant is that my education was paid for by grants and other government money, but I never spent any of the money in those accounts for food. Back when I was working as a student, I earned maybe $5/h, that wasn't enough for a lavish lifestyle but it was and would still be enough today for what I needed - even today, you can find housing for $100-200/month (that's 4-5 days of work) and food at $5-10/day, if you don't work in the food industry.	Pay out on the remainder. If after you apply it to tuition and board you have money left, usually the remainder gets dispersed to you in the form of a check. I had a friend where this happened. He was going to a smaller college and had a student loan. After the tuition was paid for that semester, he had a few hundred bucks left over that the school bursar dispensed to him as a check.	That seems like a recipe for disaster. You can get a ""school"" to sign you up, cancel your classes and you can pocket a multi-thousand dollar unsecured loan? Especially with government funds, you should have to account for every dime spent and pay back unauthorized spending.	Not really. The money goes directly to the school to pay your tuition. If you withdraw or cancel all your classes, they don't give you the money. The money that the student gets is residual aid, or what's left over after paying for tuition, room/board, fees, and whatever. This is usually a fairly small portion of the loan, and a lot of students use the residual to pay for books and other expenses. Also, if you withdraw having already been given the residual aid, you are billed and expected to pay it back pr 	Nope, I'm a millenial per definition. I just never had to deal with living off debt, I only spent what I had.		 as many as one in five college kids may be using their student loans to cash in on the cryptocurrency craze	So that's anywhere from zero to 1 in 5 real specific range--assholes.

Whatever their concentrations, they will soon be broke, out of school, no job prospects, and hoping that the STEM students will create the tech that will one day fund their Universal Basic Income.	I don't know about cryptocurrency, though.	What I do know is that I felt very proud to not take the full cost of attendance out as loans when I was doing my degree. I thought (and the ""adults"" told me) that I was very smart to minimize my borrowing.	I know two separate people who took out the full cost of attendance loan (max they could get) every semester they were in school, and used that money as down payments on their first rental buildings. Years later, they both now have small real estate empires, the loans are paid off, and one retired in his '30s, all started by student loans. Both leveraged their student loan debt into investments that paid off.	Meanwhile, I was under the debt thumb for years and years and am still working for a salary 50+ hours a week. Someone was smart, and it wasn't me (despite what the older generation applauded me for).	On the other hand, I'm not sure that cryptocurrency is quite the same deal. Seems like it would be smarter to invest and rent-seek as the people that I know did.	Considering the level of supervision in some school IT departments I've seen, they might be mining it.	They're pretty much screwed anyway, with hopeless debt, a dead-end job if they can find one, and a society that is unraveling before their very eyes.	Really, what have they got to lose?	Unless they're going into law, medicine, or high finance, how much bleaker can their future be?

Rule number one of investing: only invest money you don't need. Borrowing money to invest is a complete contradiction. In the case of student loans that may not be such a problem (not living in the US I have no idea how well protected you are).
	
Rule number two of investing: only invest in what you understand. Debatable in this case.
	
Rule number three of investing (as opposed to speculation): do value investing. No investment whatsoever could be further away from value investing than crypto currency. I am a sufficiently old fart to know that what went up yesterday and the day before may go down tomorrow, especially if it has no intrinsic value.

Especially the bold part.

I remember being that age, I remember I used to always put nonsense down on surveys, I never answered accurately.  College aged students are the least reliable group to give surveys to.

70,newsfeeds@nzherald.co.nz,"	 It's one of the more unusual deals in the art world: After more than a decade, an Alberta businessman has finally found a buyer for his prized collection of gold castings of Nelson Mandela's hand. The final price? Ten million dollars - in bitcoin.	 Attempts by Malcolm Duncan, formerly of South Africa, to sell the hands in 2007 were scuppered by controversy over provenance and a possible missing charitable donation. This time he's had better luck, albeit with an unusual buyer.	 Little information is available about Arbitrade, an Ontario-based cryptocurrency company, something Chairman Len Schutzman says is about to change.	 The company is ""weeks away"" from doing an initial coin offering and is building a facility in Waterloo, Ontario, to mine its own cryptocurrencies and plans to trade others. Its key selling point, he says, is that it will back all its virtual coins with some percentage of physical metal - including gold.	 Mandela's solid gold hand would seem to fit the bill, although as a general rule Schutzman says he'll seek to acquire gold bars or coins rather than art. Weighing 20 pounds, the value of the gold is a fraction of the artifacts' purchase price. Their real value is one of publicity, as a means of educating millennials about Mandela - and Arbitrade - through a global ""Golden Hands of Nelson Mandela"" tour the company plans to launch, he said.	 The hands aren't the first examples of ""Mandela Art"" to prove tricky to buyers and sellers. After the anti-apartheid revolutionary was released from prison, thousands of pieces of art bearing his name began flooding the market. Various scandals, including allegations of forgery, put a stop to the deluge.	 Under Mandela's own orders, many works were destroyed and the subject remains a touchy one in South Africa to this day. Duncan believes he owns the only four surviving casts of Mandela's hand, palm and fist, tucked into bespoke imbuia wood boxes. ""He cut his thumb quite badly on Robben Island, his right thumb, and you can see it,"" Duncan said.	 Photographs show Mandela sitting for the castings, which were made by a defunct division of Harmony Gold Mining Co. in 2002. As a condition of being allowed to buy the artifacts, Duncan says he paid double the 1.8 million-rand purchase price with the understanding Harmony would give half to Mandela's charities. Whether that happened remains unclear.	 Harmony has ""supplied Mr. Duncan with the necessary paperwork verifying the provenance as requested by his attorneys,"" Harmony Investor Relations Manager Lauren Fourie said by email, declining to comment when asked about the status of the donation.	 So far, Duncan has been paid a bitcoin deposit that has been converted to $50,000. The rest is due to be delivered in quarterly installments of at least $2 million per extremity, starting April 30.	 ""They take possession when I have the dollar amount in the bank,"" says Duncan, who has insisted Arbitrade guarantee the value in U.S. dollars, and handle the conversion.

Subscribe Now	NOW READING:	Op Ed: A Quick-Start Token Sale Compliance Guide: What You Need to Know	Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and with the economic sanctions administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) can be a daunting task for any business. When it comes to the fast-moving world of token sales and cryptocurrencies in general, much of the legal and regulatory landscape is yet to be settled, but the obligation to comply with AML and OFAC laws is clear. This quick start guide to AML and OFAC compliance aims to provide entrepreneurs and in-house counsel an early roadmap for planning and reaching their compliance goals as they think about kicking off a token sale.	This guide focuses on U.S. laws, but be aware that other countries also have laws in these two areas.	It states the obvious, of course, to say steer clear of tainted funds. But whether you are starting a new cryptocurrency exchange business or selling tokens to raise money for your new project, it takes intentional focus and care to ensure that the funds moving into and through your business are not the product of illegal activity. With several recent notorious examples of theft, fraud and money laundering fresh in the minds of government regulators and investigators, it is even more imperative that entrepreneurs establish and use the right anti-money laundering procedures up front.	Whether your business model or planned token sale requires that you have a formal anti-money laundering program in place or not, you are always required to avoid conducting transactions involving criminal proceeds. Among others things, federal anti-money laundering laws prohibit the following types of financial transactions:			Not only are the above offenses subject to criminal or civil prosecution, but the proceeds of criminal activity, as well as any property “involved” in a money-laundering offense — which may include such things as non-tainted funds in the same account, commissions or fees, websites or even an entire business — are subject to criminal or civil forfeiture.	In this environment, then, is it enough, for example, to require a buyer of your tokens to represent to you in writing that the funds they are paying you with are “clean”? Maybe, but maybe not. If your buyer makes that representation but there are red flags around the transaction suggesting otherwise, those representations by themselves will not insulate you from liability.	As we discuss below, if your business model puts you in the category of being a money services business, you will need to take additional steps. If not, you will still want to make sure you know and understand your customer and their transaction; be on the lookout for transaction details that are not customary; and keep records of your due diligence. 	Probably the most significant question you will need to answer in relation to your anti-money laundering obligations as you prepare to undertake a token sale is whether your sale amounts to “money transmitting” under federal law. Be aware that “money transmitters” are also highly regulated under each state’s laws, many of which require advance licensure; however, because state money transmitting laws are typically aimed at consumer protection rather than anti-money laundering, we do not address the issue of state regulation here other than to note that there is no uniform licensing scheme across the 50 states.	Under federal law, “financial institutions,” which include “money transmittersx” (a category of “money services businesses”), are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311, et seq., and are subject to a number of specific requirements that are defined and overseen by the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). According to FinCEN, “money transmitting services” means:	FinCEN issued guidance in 2013 making clear that it views its money-transmitting regulations as applying to “persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting or transmitting virtual currencies.” With regard to token issuers using a decentralized network, FinCEN has concluded that anyone who qualifies as a virtual currency “exchanger” is a money transmitter.	Even more specifically, while not formal industry guidance, in a letter responding to a Member of Congress (that became public in early March but was issued on February 13, 2018), FinCEN expressed its view that initial coin offerings (“ICOs”) qualify as money transmitting, stating:	Importantly, entities or individuals who do not follow these rules and that operate an unlicensed money transmitting business are subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1960. Yet, to further complicate matters, FinCEN’s letter also noted that an ICO involving securities or derivatives might instead be subject to the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission, each of which have separate — although similar — AML/CFT requirements. 	Ultimately, whether you will need to register with FinCEN as a money transmitter is going to depend on the specific facts and circumstances of your token sale and business model, but you will want to consider this question carefully. 	If you are a money transmitter and subject to FinCEN’s regulations, you are subject to a number of specific requirements. First, you must register as a money-transmitting business within 180 days from the date the business was established and maintain a list of any agents working with you. Most broadly, money transmitters are required to:	Additionally, you will be subject to a number of reporting and record-keeping requirements, particularly the requirement to file Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, for transactions over $2,000 that appear to involve funds from illicit activity; be designed to evade reporting requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act; or serve no apparent lawful or business purpose.	To meet AML requirements, money transmitters must have a formal AML compliance program that includes the following four elements: 1) written policies and procedures; 2) a designated AML compliance officer; 3) independent review and monitoring of the AML program; and 4) a training program for relevant personnel regarding their AML responsibilities.	Finally, while it may be possible to assign the responsibilities for your AML program to a founder, manager or employee with other duties if your business does not currently support a stand-alone function, keep in mind that it is critical that this function be resourced and, most importantly, free from the influence of the business or sales side of the organization.	Operating a money transmitting business without meeting these requirements established by the Bank Secrecy Act could subject both your business and the individuals involved in it to civil and criminal penalties.	Many participants in the cryptocurrency and token sale marketplace are based outside of the United States. If you have what FinCEN refers to as foreign “agents” — a term it uses to include “authorized delegates, foreign agents or counterparties, agents and sub-agents” — your AML program must meet additional requirements.	For example, if you have a contractual arrangement to make your tokens available to a foreign company or its customers through the foreign company’s software platform, you must:			While you may be able to contractually allocate the responsibility for developing these policies, procedures and internal controls to your agent or counterparty, you will remain liable to ensure that they are fully operational.	Every U.S. person and business is required to avoid engaging in financial transactions with certain individuals, entities and countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Accordingly, when you offer your tokens for sale in a public or private offering, it is your obligation to ensure that none of your purchasers are on the list of prohibited individuals or entities maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). You also need to be sure that your customers and other business partners are not based in countries subject to broader economic sanctions, the list of which currently includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and the Crimean region of Ukraine.	Compliance with the economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC and compliance with the AML laws established under the Bank Secrecy Act are often considered in the same breath. And, while effective OFAC screening and AML programs will certainly have areas of overlap, namely a robust customer identification procedure, they are two separate and distinct programs and responsibilities and you should have separate procedures for each.	OFAC compliance involves screening the names of individuals or entities against a highly complex and often-changing list of sanctioned parties, countries and regions. Most companies make use of third-party servicers to conduct this screening on their behalf, but it is prudent to do some due diligence to ensure those service providers themselves have the sophistication required to capture any potential prohibited transactions.	Can you shortcut this process by simply having your token buyer represent they are not on the OFAC sanctions list? While such representations are helpful, they are not sufficient. Unlike the risk-based compliance expectations, with AML requirements, you are strictly liable for OFAC screening failures and OFAC can pursue even minor violations. 	Nonetheless, should you be found to have violated economic sanctions laws, the strength of your OFAC compliance program, along with your state of mind and other factors, will be considered in the determination of any penalty.	As with any business, when operating in the cryptocurrency space, you should be prepared for questions from a regulator or investigator with jurisdiction over the activity. Whether you are a money transmitter with a formal written AML program or not, one of the first demands you are likely to receive in any federal or state inquiry is to produce a copy of your AML program and policies as well as your customer identification procedures and screening protocols. 	Examiners or investigators will be looking at whether you have taken the time to recognize and identify risk factors and risk categories for the counterparties with whom you are doing business. And they will look to see whether you have developed procedures intended to mitigate those risks and avoid conducting transactions with or for blocked parties or illicit funds. If you are equipped with written AML guidance and OFAC screening processes, including a clear allocation of responsibility within your company for ensuring compliance, you will be off to a good start.	Federal agencies involved in regulating and overseeing the marketplace for token sales recognize the value to our society of the emerging technologies behind this activity, even if they are scrambling to catch up with the technology on an institutional level. While the burden to a new company of meeting the legal and regulatory requirements for AML and OFAC compliance is not insignificant, prior planning in these areas will protect your investment of time and resources and create room for greater innovation.

76,James Hanshaw,"Natural gas will increasingly replace coal and oil.	Prices are impossible to predict and will remain volatile for now.	Excellent investment opportunities exist among service companies in the ""new oil"" world.	The US has a chronic trade deficit; gas and gas product exports will help alleviate that.	For many years oil has been the world's most traded commodity and its cousin, natural gas - gas for short in this article - has been treated almost with disdain. If a picture paints a thousand words this chart does likewise on gas pricing since the US shale gas revolution.	

	It is also reflected in the fact that vast volumes have been and still are flared off at oil producing sites around the world and also in the seemingly frivolous attitude of the US Henry Hub price which apparently deems the weather in Brooklyn to be more important than demand in Beijing or Britain. The latter being a country where they cannot get enough and are now importing LNG - liquefied natural gas - from Russia at a time new problems have arisen with that country over an alleged nerve gas attack by Russia on a former spy living in Britain. Stranger even than that the US - a country that has an abundance of gas and is exporting LNG around the world - this winter received two cargoes of LNG from Russia to save the people in Boston from freezing. Surprising that did not make headline news on CNN and others that talk instead of yet more US sanctions against Russia! Perhaps the US also has sanctions against itself if the Jones Act prevents shipping of US LNG around the US coast because the LNG carrying vessels are not made in the US! Similarly tariffs on steel - a low value commodity - may put up the cost of the pipes that transport the gas inland because insufficient of those are made in the ""make America great again"" US. 	Instead of guessing where prices are going I will look at demand trends and they are going in one direction only - up. 	Apart from the strange way of politics mentioned above politics generally worldwide relating to pollution are ensuring gas is becoming an indispensable partner with renewables in efforts to clean up the global environment. The International Energy Agency, IEA, calculates that gas and renewables share of energy supply could reach 54% of total supply by 2040 with gas providing the main share of that. This article in the Financial Times has more on the growing clout of gas. Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) also puts it well in its warning of a coming LNG supply crunch. Interestingly Shell is entering a venture with Saudi Arabia to supply gas to that major oil producer as the Saudis want to divert more of their oil consumption from power generation to oil exports by using gas for power generation instead.	Some specific points include: 	- The American Chemistry Council, ACC, has said that at least 85% of US petrochemical production uses gas or gas liquids as feedstock and 310 projects with a capital investment value of $185 billion had been announced by mid 2017. Excellent sources of information are in here.	- US ethane is being shipped to Europe for use in petrochemical plants there. One of my investments Range Resources(NYSE:RRC) is supplying some of that.	- The IEA estimates that growing electricity demand in China will require the equivalent of today's US power system to be added by 2040 and gas will be used mainly to get away from the killer pollution caused today by coal fired power stations.	- In the US around 33% of electricity will come from gas fired power stations by the end of 2018 as the result of the change there from coal in very recent years and gas will become an increasing part of the mix for the long term thereafter. 	- India is now the world's third largest energy consumer and the economy there is now growing at a faster rate than China's. It has massive pollution problems and gas fired power stations will provide the bulk of the increased supply need to underpin that growth and supply power to the estimated 240 million people who still have no electricity at all in their homes. 	One action soon is the launching auction for right to distribute gas in 156 largely urban districts in an effort to fight air pollution, as the Modi government looks to kick start the adoption of natural gas.	Both India and China will require imported gas in the form of LNG as they have insufficient resources of their own.	- Selling gas to the energy rich Middle East sounds like selling coal to Newcastle but that has started with shipments of US LNG to Kuwait and Dubai.	- The IEA estimates that the EU's own gas output will decrease by 50% from current levels at the same time as gas demand increases to accommodate nuclear and coal plant closures.	- Similar demand needs are arising in Hong Kong and South Korea and that gas will have to be imported.	- Trucks, busses and cars are another increasing source of demand as increasing numbers come on the roads using LNG and CNG (compressed natural gas). Spanish car maker SEAT - part of VW - is making hybrids using CNG. Sweden's Volvo is selling LNG powered trucks in Europe and that will spread to other countries. Italy's IVECO recently unveiled a new LNG fuelled truck with a range of 1600 kms (960 miles) that cuts particle emissions by 95% and CO2 emissions by 90%. Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) is building LNG/CNG refuelling stations around the US. 	- Trains are converting to LNG. Spain will soon run its first LNG fuelled passenger train. Russia is developing LNG fuelled freight trains to serve remote areas and Florida East Coast Railway has become the first North American rail company to use LNG for its entire fleet.	- Ships worldwide must comply with new regulations forcing them to use cleaner fuels and LNG will be a logical fuel to convert to especially for LNG carrying vessels. Ship&Bunker estimates that the 600 ships expected to use LNG would mean a demand of over 3 million M tonnes per year. The Carnival cruise line already has 9 LNG fuelled passenger ships with more on order. 	One can go anywhere in the world and find power supply problems looming not only from normal demand growth but from new sources of demand being added to that. We hear much about the rapid development of electric vehicles, EVs, but little about the increased demand recharging their batteries will place on power supply systems. Crypto currencies are enormous users of energy; Bitcoin alone requires as much as all the EVs currently in use around the world require for recharging. The Motherboard site recently had an estimate that showed a single Bitcoin transaction requires 215 kilowatt hours of electricity which is the same as the amount used by an American household in one week! 	Gas will become more and more the main practical and political supply solution to satisfy this increased demand in a cleaner way than increased use of coal and oil. And there is plenty of gas to supply that.	Major gas producing nations are Australia, Qatar and Russia. They will continue to be important suppliers but each has problems - all different - that could interrupt their ability to supply reliably. The US is rapidly becoming increasingly important due to reliability and low prices and this will continue as more and more export facilities are completed.	I will not dwell on the supply side today but my choice of gas producer investments are all US companies; Antero Resources (NYSE:AR), EQT corp (NYSE:EQT) and Range Resources (RRC). They have all performed poorly for a while now due to excess supply worldwide and low prices but that will change in the medium term. My main purpose today is to highlight those I believe will be winners on the service and infrastructure part of the supply equation.	- Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG). I start with Cheniere because it has been my best investment ever in this sector. I bought in at $3.42 and sold some all the way up to $80. Those prices were before it had even shipped any LNG and now its production is nearing full swing I see no reason why the price will not return to $80 from today's level of around $54. Recently Cheniere signed a 25 year LNG supply contract with China keeping it at the head of the race that will see more US LNG export facilities continue to come on stream into the 2020s. 	- Burckhardt Compressions (BCKDY:PNK) may not be a household name but it is a world leading manufacturer of reciprocating compressors. It is a Swiss company operating in more than 80 countries and has production and assembly facilities in the US. Its products are used in virtually all gas applications including LNG fuelled ships. I own it on the Zürich exchange under the symbol BCHN and would recommend buying it there as the US listing is thinly traded. It is very sound financially and in my opinion is significantly underpriced at present. Buying it on its home exchange also means an investment in the world's strongest currency - the Swiss franc. 	- Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) is a world leader in cryogenics. I know little about that but do know that GTLS products are used in many LNG export and import facilities around the world. It also makes tanks for transporting LNG by road and rail, for storage and it makes end user filling station equipment. Like many companies in the sector it has suffered from the long period of low gas prices but it emerged from that in a sound financial state ready for the growth opportunities ahead.	- Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB) provides reservoir description, production enhancement and reservoir management services to the gas and oil sector on and offshore. It is very profitable with an ROE of 57% and a very wide technical moat that makes it unlikely its performance will be threatened by others in the foreseeable future. 	- C&J Energy Services (NYSEMKT:CJ) is one of the largest completion and production services companies in the US. Its services include fracturing, wireline, coiled tubing, cementing, rig and fluid management services. It went through Chapter 11 proceedings and is now nicely cash flow positive with no debt.	- Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG) is my preferred LNG midstream company because it is involved in all parts of the seaborne supply chain. 	- Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure (NYSE:SOI)is a relatively new and small company offering specialised, patented proppant management systems. It is growing fast and that growth appears to be soundly underpinned financially.	HEALTH WARNING. My first example in the Demand chapter was the huge investments in plastics production facilities. This is a two edged sword. On one side that is good for the US economy and my investments in gas. On the other is a huge negative; we are polluting our planet with plastics. I therefore urge every one to search for products in paper, glass and cardboard packaging, carefully separate their plastics for recycling and try to avoid plastics that cannot be recycled - I believe black plastic is one of those. 	For virtually all other uses gas is better for the environment than the coal and oil it is replacing. It has its own dangers such as the leakage of methane and here it is good to see some leadership from one of the oil and gas majors; Exxon is taking unilateral action to curb methane leaks from its shale oil and gas operations. Others will follow that lead. Bad emissions from gas fired power plants should be limited by positive developments there too.	The only threat I see to gas use is a solar disrupter. The sun sends more energy to the earth in a week than the earth needs in a year. We have had silicon cells built into panels since the 1950s and the cost of those has come down sufficiently for them to become an important source of clean energy today but by 2030 they are expected to reach their economic and technical limits so much more from such sources is limited. Among emerging solar technologies are perovskites (sounds rather Russian and may face sanctions?!) that are crystalline minerals and could provide far superior alternatives to existing solar technologies but massive amounts of capital investment and probably a long time is first needed for their development; essential ingredients that are not readily available in much of today's short sighted world. 	As for gas prices, I said at the start I will not try to guess where they will go. They have bounced around mostly below $3 per million BTUs for the past 12 months and have been in bear market territory for around 10 years as the chart at the beginning of this article shows. When does a bear market end?!	One thing I am fairly sure about, things are not going to get worse from here and if they stay close to $3 my producer companies (AR) (EQT) and (RRC) should remain cash flow positive and producing provided they do that without over producing. If prices stay under around $5 many US producers will become nicely profitable and will continue to win against the higher prices from other large gas producing nations such as Australia where new LNG export projects have been shelved or cancelled due to massive cost overruns building existing ones, Qatar faces Middle East problems and Russia faces more sanctions for its alleged misbehaviour in other countries. I have yet to see calculations but the growing volumes of exports will help eat into the huge trade imbalances the US has with other countries and that is good for the economy generally as are all the massive investments in building petrochemical plants and LNG export facilities. 	And if those US producers keep on producing my service company ""winners"" will do very well indeed. Readers will have their own views and favourites and if they share those in comments here that will help us all be winners. 	One thing is for sure - the weather in Brooklyn will soon dictate gas prices no more!	Disclosure: I am/we are long AR, SOI, CLB, CJ, EQT, GTLS,LNG, GLOG.

77,Stan Higgins,"Actor Steven Seagal made headlines in February when he endorsed the ""Bitcoiin"" cryptocurrency, but his role as brand ambassador has apparently come to an end.	In a March 26 statement, the group behind the Bitcoiin cryptocurrency said that both Seagal and the ""founders"" of the project are exiting in light of the token sale's completion.	The post stated:	""As Bitcoiin goes through the conversion phase from token to mineable coin we wish to advise that Bitcoiin will join the likes of the original Bitcoin and become a truly open source. Therefore a big thank you to the Founders and to our Brand Ambassador whom we wish all the best in their future endeavors. However, from this point on Bitcoiin will function within its ecosystem and become a genuinely anonymous cryptocurrency with no individual or individuals having control over the entity!"" 	As previously reported, outside of Seagal, it hasn't been clear who is exactly behind the project, though BehindMLM, a blog that covers multi-level marketing schemes, has profiled some of the efforts to promote the token sale following a cease-and-desist order from regulators in New Jersey. A now-deleted webinar, originally posted to YouTube, had previously claimed that the team behind Bitcoiin wished to remain anonymous.	The exits also come days after regulators in the state of Tennessee issued a warning to investors about Bitcoiin, citing the action in New Jersey.	Seagal has made no public comment regarding his exit via Twitter, where he has posted a number of promotional messages during the Bitcoiin token sale. The last one teased news about a forthcoming exchange listing, though it's not clear which market he was referring to.	The statement issued Monday highlighted the push toward open-source development, though efforts to do this publicly seem to have only begun earlier this year. A GitHub page associated with Bitcoiin features a fork of the Go-Ethereum (geth) client, listing changes that appear to be largely cosmetic.	For example, a commit from nine days ago features changes like adjusting the email address for ethereum founder Jeffrey Wilcke from ""jeffrey@ethereum.org"" to ""jeffrey@bitcoiin2g.org.""	The press release also emphasized that, following the token sale, ""neither STAKING nor REFERRALS will exist in the blockchain or the Bitcoiin ecosystem."" The group blames ""the media which believe in sensationalism instead of reality"" for spreading this idea, though Bitcoiin's own statement from February 5 outlined how ""Bitcoiin Staking"" would let ""anyone holding Bitcoiin in their wallet...receive interest on their balance in return for helping maintain the security of the network.""	""The 1% reward is generated through our mining eco-system and hence we are able to provide the guaranteed monthly return,"" the statement explained at the time.	It's not clear how much money has been raised during the ICO, though the group claimed earlier this month that its $75 million ""soft cap"" had been reached.	Image Credit: Gage Skidmore/Flickr

78,Anna Hensel,"Above: Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency	Twitter, following in the footsteps of Google and Facebook, will now ban ads for ICOs and token sales.	Reuters first reported the ban. A Twitter spokesperson told VentureBeat that the new policy will roll out starting tomorrow, and will be fully enforceable to all advertisers within approximately a month.	“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community. As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency. Under this new policy, the advertisement of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and token sales will be prohibited globally. We will continue to iterate and improve upon this policy as the industry evolves,” a statement from Twitter provided to VentureBeat read.	Twitter’s financial services policy has already been updated to reflect the ban.	Twitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey is bullish on cryptocurrency, telling. London news outlet The Times last week that he believes everyone will be using Bitcoin in 10 years or less. Still, cryptocurrency use hasn’t reached widespread adoption among average consumers. That makes it ripe for unethical advertisers to spread misinformation.	BuzzFeed reported last month that automated Twitter accounts impersonating Elon Musk and Donald Trump were encouraging Twitter users to donate Bitcoin or Ethereum to dubious crypto wallet addresses, with messages like “I’m donating 250 BITCOIN! to the BTC community! First 250 transactions with 0.2 BTC sent to the address below will receive 1.0 BTC in the address the 0.2 BTC came from!” After the report came out, Twitter said it would start taking down these accounts.	Facebook and Google announced that they would be banning cryptocurrency ads in January and March respectively. Facebook’s ban has already taken effect, though Google’s won’t be implemented until June.","Twitter, following in the footsteps of Google and Facebook, will now ban ads for ICOs and token sales.

80,Financial Times,"Hannah Murphy	Twitter will ban adverts for certain cryptocurrency services as well as initial coin offerings, following in the footsteps of Google and Facebook as large technology groups respond to pressure to protect consumers from scams. 	The San-Francisco based company said that it would introduce a global ban on advertising for ICOs — a crowdfunding mechanism using digital currencies. It will also only allow advertising from cryptocurrency exchanges and online cryptocurrency wallet services that are listed publicly on “certain major stock markets”, it added.	The move is another blow to the fast-growing infrastructure that supports digital currency issuance and trading. 	National watchdogs, many of whom are considering whether to impose their own regulatory clampdown, have warned investors that the sector is vulnerable to fraud. Twitter’s bid to clean up its advertiser base comes after it emerged that the platform has been used as a vehicle for online cryptocurrency scams, with fraudsters setting up fake profiles to promote bogus ICOs or encouraging pump and dump schemes. 	Earlier this year, large cryptocurrency exchange Kraken and Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, issued warnings that they were being imitated on Twitter by fraudsters making fake promotions. 	“We are committed to ensuring the safety of the Twitter community,” Twitter said in a statement on Monday. “As such, we have added a new policy for Twitter Ads relating to cryptocurrency . . . We will continue to iterate and improve upon this policy as the industry evolves.” 	Twitter said that in Japan, where regulators are cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges, it would only allow adverts from exchanges formally regulated by its Financial Services Agency. 	The prohibition follows a similar move from Google, who earlier this month announced a ban on all adverts for cryptocurrencies and ICOs, while Facebook said in January that it would impose similar restrictions. 	Nevertheless, some critics warn that the decisions mean big technology companies are becoming overly influential — more so even than regulators — around how financial services products are advertised. 	The price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, fell more than 4 per cent on Monday to about $8,080. It has sunk by more than half from a peak of about $20,000 in December.

81,Michelle Meyers,"CNET también está disponible en español.	Don't show this again	As was expected, the company joins Facebook and Google in a crackdown intended to protect consumers.	Twitter plan to ban cryptocurrency ads on its site will start rolling out Tuesday.	Twitter has confirmed a report that it's joining Google and Facebook in banning advertisement on its site for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.	As part of its commitment to ""ensuring the safety of the Twitter community,"" the social media site is adding a new policy prohibiting the advertisement of initial coin offerings and token sales, a Twitter representative said Monday in an emailed statement.	The ban will be rolled out starting Tuesday and will be full enforceable for all advertisers within about a month.	It makes Twitter just the latest tech giant to ban such ads. In January, Facebook said it wouldn't allow crypto ads on its social network, and Google followed course last week. Reddit has reportedly banned crypto ads since 2016.	The bans are blows to the nascent market for digital coins but are implemented in the name of consumer protection. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies struggle with fraudulent activity and illegal transactions. Because digital coin exchanges are still largely unregulated and transactions are hard to reverse, they've become targets for scams and hacks.	Last week Sky News reported that Twitter was planning a crypto ban, citing a person familiar with the plans.	Be respectful, keep it clean and stay on topic.
